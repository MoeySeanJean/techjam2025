Faber Point was absolutely amazing. The weather was perfect, and the views were out of this world. We consider it a hidden gem—not many people seem to talk about it.

Lai Chi Mian has already established a loyal following of fans and no wonder cos they serve THE BEST thick-cut slices of Pork Liver this side of the country.

Next door, a Xiao Chao stall over a huge selection of freshly prepared Pork Rice to one of the better Sambal Stingrays I’ve had in a long time. Their Yu Pin Mai Fun is also yummy.

As a comparison, we purchased both Maguro and Salmon Belly from the various supermarkets and Meidi-Ya came out tops with deeper flavours while the others were somewhat bland.

We enjoy the beef cuts as well and can never resist going overboard, planning for yakiniku feasts over the weekends.

The wagyu beef chuck is a sure bet, beautifully marbled and assuredly soft. It only requires a 30-second sear before slinging it into your gob.

The pork jowls are also a must-have but it always needs a little seasoning to stand up to the rich flavoured cuts of beef. We even grab the yusheng from them because we trust the freshness.

I would, however, steer clear of any fruits they have on sale. They are on sale for a reason and we learnt it the hard way.

In any case, our pampered feline used to love her tiny morsels of Maguro and Sake from Meidi-Ya and just for those precious memories alone, I'll admit I'm biased and have a fondness for this supermarket.

We loaded $120 onto our card, which got us 240 credits thanks to a top-up bonus. That turned out to be a lot of playtime—and honestly, we were glad it was, because burning through those credits took a while and gave us time to try out a bunch of different games.

We started off with the bumper cars, not once but twice—mostly because they were the most expensive and we figured we’d get the “value” out of them early. But they were genuinely fun, especially with a group of colleagues all chasing and crashing into each other in pure chaos. After that, we tried out the simulator rides—both bike and car. The bike one, in particular, was surprisingly thrilling. It had just the right mix of arcade jank and adrenaline rush.

One of the unexpected highlights for us was the basketball hoops game. It got super competitive, with everyone trying to outscore each other in short bursts. It brought out the trash talk and cheerleader energy in equal parts, and it was a good way to see everyone loosen up and have fun without overthinking it.

The vibe inside the arcade is bright, energetic, and buzzing. Even though it’s inside a mall, Timezone VivoCity doesn’t feel like a tucked-away corner—it feels like a mini amusement park. There’s something here for everyone, whether you’re into retro claw machines, music rhythm games, or the newer VR setups.

Overall, it was a great mix of nostalgia and new experiences. It’s not just for kids—there’s more than enough here for adults to enjoy too. Whether you’re going with family, friends, or workmates, Timezone VivoCity is the kind of place that brings people together to play, compete, laugh, and just enjoy being in the moment.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-23T05:38:34.135093Z,Dhananjay Garg

Review: February 2023
The Teban Gardens Food & Market place , Transit Bin Centre is being used by a rowdy individual  for his personal use . Despite posting & informing the relevant authorities,  he now keeps using  it solely for his personal use in a discreet manner. He doesn't allow the engaged cleaners to come near or use it.

Much should & can be done by residents community organisations but unfortunately they seem unconcern but only frequent CHATs.. The place has several serious issues and since unresolved for years, have gotten to a worse stage.

Bonus point: met so many fun people here — apparently a lot of folks who didn’t get into Rabbit Hole (the new viral gay club) end up here, so... yes, the eye candy is real 😆 but even beyond that, the crowd was fun, respectful, and full of good energy.

Also, shoutout to the fact that they have an OUTDOOR SMOKING AREA — yes!!! You can actually step out, get some air, and still be part of the vibe. It's little things like this that make a night out feel just right.

Entry & Pricing
Upon arrival, we were offered two options: $60 standard entry or $80 with bar coupons. We opted for the latter, assuming it would provide better value – a decision we quickly regretted. The coupon system felt like a marketing gimmick rather than genuine added value.

Atmosphere & Crowd
The venue was surprisingly sparse, with fewer than 30 patrons despite the modest space. Even accounting for the club's compact size, the atmosphere felt lifeless and lacking the energy you'd expect from a proper nightlife venue. The sparse crowd made the evening feel more awkward than intimate.

Interior & Cleanliness
The bar area desperately needs renovation – the aesthetic can only be described as dated and uninspiring, reminiscent of an old Eastern Bloc establishment. More concerning was the cleanliness standard: our table left black residue on contact, suggesting poor maintenance and hygiene practices. This immediately raised red flags about the venue's upkeep.

Facilities
The restroom facilities were particularly disappointing – cramped, unclean, and genuinely uncomfortable to use. For a venue charging premium entry prices, basic cleanliness should be non-negotiable.
Redeeming Features
The only highlight was the outdoor terrace area, which provided a brief respite from the indoor environment and served as a decent smoking area.

Verdict
After less than an hour, our group decided to cut our losses and leave. For $80 per person, there are numerous superior venues in Singapore that offer better atmosphere, cleanliness, and overall experience. Tuff Club needs significant improvements in maintenance, crowd management, and basic hygiene standards before it can compete with the city's established nightlife scene.

It was empty at 12.30AM, but I'm not sure if there's a crowd later. That's what the door lady said, but we didn't stay. The service was really bad - it was as if we owed the both of them money, and they talked to us really rudely which put us off. The main reason for the 1 star review.
The music inside was sort of electro, dance floor was big and I can imagine that it'd be nice if there was a crowd and the music was more danceable to, but it just wasn't my type of music, nor my friends'. Drinks were priced average at $15.
However once again, what really put us off from this club was the way we were talked to.",en,6 years ago,2018-11-09T16:51:34.002111324Z,Yunn

Roy from Zenith Auotmotive appeared to be “Mr Nice Guy” but he is actually a wolf under a sheep skin. Zenith Automotive is managed by Roy, his wife, his son and daughters. I’ve been repairing my car at zenith for more than 5 years. My whole family too as we are all staying nearby. He was introduced to us by our Cycle&Carriage salesperson Han Ai Lin. At first, he appeared to be very nice and honest. But after a few repairs, I felt that something was off. Everytime we repair a problem, a new problem will arise. At first I thought it was pure coincidence but this not only happened to me all the time, but also my dad’s, my mum’s and my sis’s car. The last I remembered was I repaired my aircon at Zenith, 1-2 days after car collection, my engine starts to make weird sounds. His charges seemed to be reasonable like repair for the aircon $800 but in the end I always have to add on another few thousands. This didn’t happen once, it happened many times. This time, I went to repair my new car as my husband has met a small accident. He repaired my bumper for few hundred dollars. He said he repaired the headlamp mounting too. After awhile, our headlights starts to turn misty and the headlights was damaged due to the mist. We went back to Cycle & Carriage and they mentioned that it was because Zenith did not repair it properly, he simply use a glue to repair the mounting, resulting the headlights to have mist and damage it. I have asked a few more workshops and they said the same thing. So his style is to charge a reasonable amount and so you have more new problems and go back and pay more money for the repair. I’ve asked a few workshop friends and realised that he is well-known to be dishonest in the industry. Please do not be fooled by them anymore!!!",en,4 months ago,2025-04-29T06:10:48.465162Z,Zann Tong

No questions asked. His son William just quietly diagnosed the problem and fixed what was needed. Uncle Roy could have said 'change all 4 sensors' and i will do it as it would be deemed necessary but no, he said 'change only the 1 of the sensor will do'

So on the eve of National Day, my colleagues and I decided to check it out.

The café is tucked away inside an industrial building, 100 Pasir Panjang, which gives it a bit of a “hidden gem” feel. From café, you get a clear view overlooking West Coast Highway, and for those driving, there’s plenty of parking available at the B1 carpark.

When we arrived, the café was packed, clearly a popular spot for the holiday eve. We had to wait quite a while for a table, but the staff’s hospitality made the wait far more pleasant. The server kindly offered us the comfy sofa seats on Level 2, where we could relax, chat, before our table was available.

I opted for the set lunch menu, which was reasonably priced given the quality. I went for the Modena pizza, a thin crust, light yet flavourful sauce, and toppings that tasted fresh and organic. It was the kind of pizza that doesn’t try too hard but wins you over with its honest, wholesome flavours.

A spot worth visiting for its friendly service, comforting food, and a good dose of Italian soul. I will probably return another day during less peak hours for brunch?",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-09T01:41:26.331573107Z,Leslie Lim

I had the Wafu spicy beef bowl, and it was an absolute flavor bomb. The beef was tender and bursting with rich, savory juices, perfectly complemented by the soft, fragrant rice. The spice added just the right amount of kick, elevating the dish to a delightful, piquant experience. Their chawanmushi was equally impressive—steamed to perfection, wonderfully seasoned, and packed with a deep umami that made every bite irresistible.

This expectation was highly unrealistic and did not take into account her age, physical condition, and the fact that she was experiencing vomiting/back pain.
Such requests can cause unnecessary stress to elderly patients and may even worsen their condition. I believe clinics should prioritise compassion, patience, and understanding when dealing with vulnerable patients, especially seniors.

Twice the Purchase, Twice the Satisfaction – Thanks CompAsia!

I’ve now bought two iPhone 15 Pro Max 1TB devices from CompAsia — one for myself, and most recently, one for my partner — and both times have been absolutely amazing experiences!

The first time, I got the iPhone 15 Pro Max for myself and was blown away by how like-new it looked and performed. Everything from the sleek design to the smooth performance felt premium and flawless.

I was so impressed that when it came time to upgrade my partner’s phone, I didn’t hesitate to return to CompAsia. The second phone was just as perfect — again, it looked brand new and worked like a charm.

Being able to pay in instalments made both purchases super manageable, and the delivery was fast and secure each time. CompAsia has truly earned my trust. Great value, great quality, and a super smooth buying experience.

Highly recommended! Perfect choice if you want top-quality devices at a more affordable price.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-09T13:50:43.891030Z,Roger Cheong

Unfortunately, my experience has been very disappointing—mainly due to the battery performance.

Before receiving the phone, I was already concerned about the battery health, and sadly, those concerns turned out to be valid. Despite being listed as “Excellent,” the battery performance is far below acceptable standards. With a full charge, the phone barely lasts 3–4 hours with normal use. Even with battery saver enabled, the percentage drops rapidly: from 100% to 93% in just 3–4 minutes, and from 63% to 32% within 30–35 minutes. That kind of battery drain is completely unacceptable for any modern smartphone, especially one that’s supposed to be in ""excellent"" condition.

As a first-time buyer from CompAsia, this experience has been extremely frustrating. I expected better quality control, especially when a device is sold with the promise of reliability and a grading of ""Excellent."" I hope the company reviews how it certifies and tests its devices before shipping them to customers.

Verdict: Not recommended if you're expecting dependable battery life. I strongly advise checking the battery health guarantee (if any) or considering other platforms with more transparent refurbishment standards.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-13T14:36:39.598773Z,Md Toriqul Islam

If your item arrive well, good for you. If they somehow send you a defective product, read on for the support you would get.

Got a set of iphones during the 7.7 promotion period, decided to go for secondhand first for my parents to see if they were comfortable with the apple environment before a complete switch but the experience is terrible. Paid for “Excellent” condition phone and added a 24-months warranty, one of the two phone went into “white death” after we just finish the basic setup (migrating the contacts and WhatsApp, installing all apps).

Contacted them for a fix and here’s when your patience is put to the test. The phone has been with us for less than 10 days, CS has to contact another team before they came up with a solution that the phone needs to be send back for fix, and the fix will take up to 18 days. The phone is unresponsive means i need to risk all the security issues because i have to surrender my password to them.

Fine, as long as they can fix.

Now, pickup can only be arranged on weekdays. I took leave to pass over the item properly, pickup tracking link said rider will be here between 9-10am, the rider no show I wrote to them and they say ignore the tracker, my timeslot is 9-1pm and they will monitor this closely. Now 3pm, no rider in sight, checked my email the “monitoring closely” obviously did not pick the issue up cause there wasnt any emails telling me the pickup could be delayed. Wrote in again, and now another waiting game.

By the way if you are on the website and only see thousands of 5star reviews, I left my 1star and it wasn’t showing, and therefore here I am… (as shown in my picture attached).

Still, waiting for a solution from CompAsia.",en,a month ago,2025-07-14T07:09:25.456935443Z,K. Ng (kaptures)

Was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the digs and the services that the staff provide. The rooms are clean, well ventilated and the beds and mattresses comfortable. For me, the most important aspect were the toilets and bathrooms - these were always kept spic and span.
The staff are all young, locals, mostly studying at colleges, and consequently really know their way around town - they're really helpful and super friendly too. If you ever have a day where you don't have much to do, relax in their common area - its the ultimate way to meet new people and make some awesome friends! All in all, a really good place to stay.
This is also one of the very few places in Singapore that i know of that doesn't burn through one's holiday money simply on accommodation costs. Very reasonably priced, it is for the budget conscious (which is, i think 90% of all travelers). Singapore is no longer a rich man's holiday destination.

Why are the prices not indicated as I could compare the price difference of certain brands and food. When I feedback this to the cashier who was a China girl and a foreign lady they kept quiet and didn't even reply me. One even showed her pissed off face to me.

Very appalled that this is the level of testing. When asked to rectify it, I was told all technicians had left for the day, and I have to return another day. I had to foot transport bills to and fro out of my pocket to compensate for their shoddy work. I had asked for compensation in the form of servicing to cover the loss incurred.

Did not expect it to be the start of many troubles.

Was wrongly advised by sales staff regarding the SG60 discounts ($120 off instead of $60) and use of climate vouchers for a dryer (cannot be used) only at the point of purchase. Decided to proceed with buying the Samsung dryer.

After purchase, did not receive any confirmation of notification of delivery of actual date, only a call 10 mins before delivery. Delivery window was 10am to 2pm, and ended up staying home for 3 hours (10am to 1pm) before getting a call that the delivery was coming. Sales staff also was hard to contact regarding delivery (2 to 3h wait, only responded after calling). Understand it was his off day, but Courts should have a staff to cover for him since it still involved deliveries, or have a more contactable number.

Sales staff also wrongly scheduled the Samsung delivery agent, so ended up the agent only came 1 day after the dryer was delivered. Asked for a specific time for the agent to come (3pm) to make up for the mistake but ended up with delaying my delivery window (originally 2 to 6pm) to 3 to 7pm. As of 545pm, the agent is still not here. (Edit: Agent ended up being late, and I was forced to take cab to my appointment)

This is one of my worst sales service to date, from pre to post sales. The only good things about this whole process was the advice given on the right dryer to buy (pre sales) and the free delivery given in an attempt to recover from the mistake in the supposed discount.

Please work on your service processes and sales recovery. It is alarming how poor the standards are.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-14T11:17:37.270844011Z,Lance Tan

He explained to me from the functions of the tv, to the differences in the different brands and also reminded me about all the after sales services they (or Samsung) could provide for me. It was a really pleasant experience at the store. And guess what’s even more incredible? He went extra miles to deliver my credit card to me after I found out that it was left at the cashier!! Really very very impressed with his service. 👍👍👍 Will definitely trust him if I ever need any other appliances for recommendation.

PS. I was actually planning to just take a look at the different TV models since I parked at Heeren to run an errand. But his sincerity in helping me changed it all. Thanks a lot, Kenneth! Happy new year! 😊",en,7 months ago,2025-01-02T09:11:02.887721Z,Janice Cuidan

We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and spaciousness of the hotel. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was surprisingly large and comfortable, and the bathroom was also spacious. The hotel even provided a hairdryer and all the necessary amenities, which was a nice touch for a budget boutique hotel. The price was very competitive compared to other hotels offering similar staycation packages.

The hotel's location is a bit secluded, making it a peaceful and quiet escape from the city buzz. We hardly heard any noise from outside the corridor or from other guests.

While the hotel is conveniently located for those with their own transport, it's preferable to have a vehicle for easy access.

This is one of the cheapest hotels in this area and Singapore is generally expensive. If you are thinking it is expensive in a general sense and should therefore be 4-star standard, please adjust your expectations.

I stayed in one of the cheapest, windowless rooms. The bed was clean, large and firm, I found it comfortable and more than acceptable. The bathroom was spacious and, if anything, the water pressure was too high and the water sometimes too hot! Service was very good. There was an iron and ironing board in the room, a kettle and pitcher was provided, with some basic tea / coffee supplies. There was a small desk that would just about be usable if you sat on the end of the bed.

The decor is, admittedly, poor in some places. Paint appears patchy and the lifts are quite old. There are things stacked in the corridors etc. The corridors were being renovated when I was staying, which was being done until 2200h and was occasionally disturbing. However, if you want a cheap room, I found it to be very clean, perhaps aside from some hair left in the shower drain that I noticed after I'd been there a few days.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Booking and checking in/out was so easy, and during my stay all the staff were kind.

The location is great if you are attending NUS or INSEAD, which are close enough to commute. West Coast Park is quite nice but obviously the CBD and most major tourist areas are over the other side of the island. By taxi it might be USD 20-30 each way (or more in rush hour), so perhaps best to stay on the East Coast unless you have time to use the public transport.

The area felt safe, many tourists, schools and residential areas. There are many public transport connections stopping in the area to take you most major places. There is a 24h 7-11 close by and some vending machines outside the hotel. The 7-11 allows you to microwave food any that you bought there so you can get a cheap hot meal. The restaurants around the area are also well-known and recommended by locals, there is a real mix of cuisines and some are quite reasonably priced.

My one major issue was that there was a peephole in my door but no cover, so the light from the corridor would light the room enough to stop me sleeping, so I had to use an eye mask. Perhaps a sticky-note would have done the job.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-27T07:15:00.650414Z,Mark Grimes

Firstly, the water heater in my shower was inconsistent and failed to provide hot water. As the second person to take a shower, I was left with only room temperature water, even after turning the tap fully to the hot side.
Additionally, I was surprised by a phone call from the front desk around 10:00 AM reminding me of the check-out time. Shortly after, at 10:20 AM, there was persistent knocking at my door, and to my shock, the staff attempted to unlock the door before I could respond. I understand the importance of check-out times, but this felt intrusive and disrespectful, especially since I was well aware of the 11:00 AM check-out policy.
When I addressed the issue at the front desk during check-out at 10:40 AM, I spoke with Ms. J, the manager on duty. While she noted my feedback and offered an apology, I wasn't left with the impression of sincerity, as she remained seated while I stood in front of the counter.
Overall, I felt unfairly treated, especially considering the price I paid for my stay. This experience has left me hesitant to book with this hotel in the future.

I just wanted to give a heads-up to the gaming community, especially those who frequent Paco Funworld and similar arcades. There's a regular adult patron who has been causing some frustration by hogging the Maximum Midnight Tune 6 machines. He shows up around the early afternoon, loads credits into four separate machines, and then only plays on one, essentially blocking others from getting a turn.

I’ve had to ask staff to step in before at a katong outlet, and while they’ve been helpful in clearing one machine, he has since moved to Stadium outlet. His reasoning that he’s ""trying to earn credit score"" doesn’t really seem to justify taking up multiple machines when others are waiting to play.

I think it’s important for both the staff and the arcade-goers to be aware of this kind of behavior. If you see him doing this again, it would be great if action could be taken to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to enjoy the game.

Just wanted to share and spread the word. Let’s keep things fun and fair for everyone!",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-13T15:29:53.257172819Z,ema tan

I was especially pleased with their friendly and helpful staff, who were always on hand to assist with any queries. The checkout process was quick and efficient, even during busy periods.

Half an hour or more going around to ask help as to how to get to the car park with a trolley of groceries.
Security staff not available at that time 10.30am , a peak hours of shoppers!
NTUC staff Lee Yun Yuan (ah wes) is helpful n very accommodative ,gave  me some ideas as to where to leave my trolley n go get my vehicle fm the car park! Staff Hertine is the first I approached n she's too very helpful n friendly.

It's ridiculous they want you to bring back the defected items to the same branch you get them from. Sheng Siong doesn't require you to bring any spoilt or rotten fresh food back to process refunds once you submit photos and receipt and that makes more sense!

If you’re around the area, Broadway Food Centre at Sim Lim Square is a super convenient spot to grab a quick and satisfying meal. It’s your typical food court setup with plenty of choices — mixed veg rice, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Malay, you name it. Really handy if you’re in Sim Lim running errands or just looking for a no-frills meal.

This time, I tried the Korean cold noodles — and honestly, it was super refreshing. The broth was chilled and tangy, with that slight sweetness and a nice kick of spice. Noodles had a good chewy texture, and it came with sliced cucumber and egg. Perfect for a hot day! Wasn’t expecting much, but it was surprisingly satisfying.

The food came out quick too, even though the place was quite packed during lunch hour. There’s always a steady crowd, but seating turnover is fast, and it’s air-conditioned, which is a big plus.

Prices are decent, portions are generous, and there’s enough variety to suit different cravings. Definitely a good go-to if you’re nearby and want something quick, hot (or cold 😄), and tasty without breaking the bank.",en,3 weeks ago,2025-08-07T12:58:29.178211514Z,Dan P

Before arriving, my husband called ahead to explain that I was in severe pain and to check if the clinic could assist. The receptionist who answered was shockingly rude — no greeting, no courtesy, just a blunt “What do you want?” That should have been the first red flag, but we held on to hope that once there, we would receive proper medical attention.

When we arrived and I informed the same receptionist that I was in intense pain, she didn’t even look up or acknowledge me with any concern. Instead, she continued chatting with another patient about billing instructions. Only after that did she turn to me — not to direct me to the doctor, but to insist on registering my IC and taking down my particulars. This, despite my repeated pleas and visible distress.

I had to reason with her — that surely I could be seen by the doctor first and the administrative steps could wait until I was stable. Her lack of urgency and basic empathy was both disturbing and unacceptable.

But what truly shocked me was the doctor’s response. After a brief glance, he immediately said, “I can’t help you, you need to go to A&E.” There was no attempt to assess, no first-aid measures, no questions — just a quick dismissal. And to make matters worse, he criticised me for being agitated due to the pain, telling me I shouldn’t behave that way. I cannot understand how a medical professional could lack such fundamental compassion and empathy. No help rendered. Continued sitting at his chair.

This entire experience was deeply traumatic, not just because of the pain I was in, but because of how dehumanising the encounter felt. There was zero empathy, zero professionalism — from the receptionist to the doctor.

If this is how you treat patients in distress, you have no place in the healthcare profession. I strongly advise others to avoid this clinic at all costs. It is simply unacceptable.

The only saving grace was one young staff who helped to call the ambulance. Thank you for your kind help.

For the corporate office: this incident occurred on Saturday, 26 July, at approximately 3:00PM. Please investigate accordingly. The staff and doctor on duty should be held accountable.",en,a month ago,2025-07-28T15:52:39.166889816Z,EPLA Tokyo

Not one to come too if there are other options available and unless one doesn’t mind being disregarded. Came because the only other option would be going to the A&E since we needed a doctor in the wee hours.

There were 2 staff at registration. The more experienced staff was rude, the other one was at best indifferent. Both were clearly unable to empathize with patients who had to seek help from a 24-hour clinic.

Doctor did the necessary checks. Minimal eye contact, empathy and was clinical. Line of questioning does not instill confidence in patients.

When medication was dispensed, brief information was given. Wouldn’t even call it “checking things off the list”.

Paid more than $200 for visit.

The only positive point about visiting was the ability to see a doctor quickly since there were no other patient and we were able to obtain medication quickly.

Hopefully at the end of enduring such behavior, the medication works and helps.",en,6 months ago,2025-03-01T23:40:50.777524Z,Diana Tan

It’s a huge park with plenty of open spaces, tree-shaded paths, and that constant breeze from the nearby sea. You can see container ships and boats out in the distance, which adds a calm, coastal feel to the place.

The children’s playground is the heart of the park and easily one of the biggest attractions here. It’s designed to cater to kids of all ages, including toddlers, so my 2-year-old had plenty to explore safely. There are smaller slides, gentle swings, and sand areas where little ones can dig and play without getting overwhelmed by the bigger kids. For older children, there are large climbing structures, rope bridges, and high slides — enough to keep them busy for hours. The ground is mostly soft and safe, so parents don’t need to worry too much about tumbles.

The McDonald’s at the park is a lifesaver for parents. It’s spacious, air-conditioned inside for a break from the sun, but it also has an outdoor seating area where you can sip your drink while watching your kids at the playground. Their latte coffee is surprisingly decent for a fast-food chain, and it’s nice to just sit back with a cup while your kid burns off energy nearby. They also serve the usual breakfast and snack options, so it’s easy to grab something quick without leaving the park.

What makes West Coast Park stand out is how it combines everything — the sea breeze, the family-friendly playground, picnic-friendly open lawns, and food options — into one spot. It’s a great choice for a morning or afternoon outing if you’ve got little ones, because you can relax, caffeinate, and let your kids enjoy themselves all in the same place.",en,a month ago,2025-07-20T19:48:32.939816083Z,Dhananjay Garg

It’s a great location for family outings, gatherings with friends, or simply enjoying nature. On weekends, it can get quite busy with many small groups gathering for picnics, celebrations, or just relaxing under the trees. We recently visited for an Aluth Avurudu ceremony, and it was a memorable experience despite some unexpected weather.

The park has a calm and peaceful environment, filled with trees and birds, making it ideal for nature lovers. You can even see ships and boats out at sea, as one side of the park is right by the water. There’s also a small beach area, which adds to the charm and gives kids a chance to explore.

There are plenty of exercise areas and a large play area for children, so it’s definitely a child-friendly place. Many people also bring tents and camp overnight, which seems to be quite popular here. If you enjoy camping, this is a great spot to try it out—but one thing to keep in mind is the lack of sheltered areas. During our visit, it started raining heavily, and there was no proper cover for rain or thunder. That’s something that could definitely be improved for the safety and comfort of visitors.

One highlight is the large McDonald’s located in the park. It’s easily accessible, and a lot of visitors stop there to grab a bite, especially with kids.

Overall, West Coast Park is a great place to relax, play, and enjoy the outdoors, but if you’re planning to stay long or camp, do keep an eye on the weather and prepare for rain. Still, it’s definitely a place worth visiting!",en,3 months ago,2025-05-03T07:18:51.570712Z,Kamal Indika Nanayakkara

The AC worked well.

Everything was clean including all common areas. The shower push is strong, which I personally like. Also, self-check-in and out was easy. It only takes a few minutes on an electronic machine outside next the hostel door.

My only mini downsides would be that
1- breakfast includes only oat and toasts (apart from coffee and tea) which is not my thing, and
2- there was nothing to dry your hand after washing them in the bathroom - you have to bring your own towel every time.

Checkin is pretty fast using the automatic machine that delivers the badge to enter the building, no deposit if booked on Agoda directly which is nice, cash deposit is requested in other cases.
Interior is kinda modern but amenities are not convienent at all. Rooms are really small, there's no place to even open a suitcase. AC is turned all the time and is really noisy. No intimacy and worse of all is the absence of windows in the room I stayed in. Seems more like a rat cage rather than a guest house.

Top tip: a big queue normally means it’s good. So if in doubt follow the crowd!

If there were an award for disappointment, Samsung would win hands down. I trusted a globally renowned brand, paid a premium, and ended up with dead pixels on my screen. A quality control issue that has been reported by countless customers worldwide — and yet, Samsung still pretends it’s not a problem.

But wait, it gets worse.

When I reached out to Samsung Singapore’s customer care, hoping for a solution, I was met with a level of indifference that was honestly insulting. Instead of helping, they had the audacity to say:
“We don’t know how you handled the phone.”
Seriously? That’s your response? Not only are your devices flawed, but now it’s the customer’s fault for expecting them to work?

I’m baffled. A flagship product with a screen issue and a support team that gaslights the user. This isn’t just bad service — it’s pathetic. For a company that spends millions on marketing and brand image, your actual product quality and support are a disgrace.

From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel at home—a great start to the meal.

We decided to try their Seafood Pasta and Prosciutto Rucola Pizza. Unfortunately, the pasta was underwhelming. For a price range of $20-$30, we expected a dish with depth of flavour and well-executed seafood, but it lacked the wow factor and didn’t feel worth the cost.

The pizza, however, was excellent—a true highlight. The dough struck a perfect balance between chewy and crispy, and the ingredients tasted fresh and high-quality. It’s clear that L’Operetta knows its way around a proper Italian-style pizza.

Would I return? Absolutely—for the pizza. But I’d skip the pasta next time. If you’re a pizza lover, this spot is definitely worth checking out!",en,7 months ago,2025-01-18T12:03:46.515702Z,Merryheart

It's definitely not your typical high-end clubbing experience, but it can be a fun night out if you go in with the right mindset. Think of it as the club equivalent of a dive bar.

You'll find a mostly young crowd, lots of 18-year-olds singing along to remixed pop songs and club anthems. If you can embrace the slightly chaotic atmosphere and have a good sense of humor, you'll find plenty to laugh about (like the ""will you be my gf"" LED bottle service message we saw!).

One upside is that the prices are incredibly reasonable, especially if you make friends with the club host and open a table. We got two bottles for eight people for just over $600, which is practically unheard of in Singapore's club scene on a weekend night.

Overall, this place is best suited for those looking for a casual, affordable night out with a younger crowd. If you're expecting a glamorous clubbing experience, you'll probably be disappointed.",en,7 months ago,2025-01-26T09:55:16.270628Z,Flo Yeow

Made to clear one side of the table as the manager said that we shouldn't occupy the whole standing table. We were placed right at the entrance, 13 of us in total and we open three bottle. Can't even have a full standing table.

After clearing all our drinks to one side, nobody else was using the cleared side table, not even the tables besides us. All were left empty. Since there is nobody using it why is there a need to force all 13 of us to stand to only one side? 3 bottles of gin that we open is still not enough??

Then at around 2a.m, staff were clearing our drinks away from the table already. We werent even finish drinking. When we came back from the dance floor, more than half of our drinks were cleared. It's like they are trying to rush us off. We don't feel welcomed.

While we were choosing food, I saw that the kimchi cup noodles was on discount 1 for 1 so I encouraged my friend to get one with me even though he already planned to get another food item.. as we paid our food together at the counter, i initially didn't calculate the prices properly but after eating I realised that $14plus for 2 cup noodles (which is supposed to be the price of one $3.20) and one chicken wrap $3.80 and one chicken breast $3.10 does not add up to $14 sth which was what she charged us for.. it was supposed to be $10.10 only.

When i went back to tell her and ask her about the price she charged, I realised that all the discount tags that were there were all taken down.. and when I told her I saw it while I was buying she said the discount doesn't exist. Another worker was there and he said that the discounts we saw were expired discounts so it no longer applies. I told them that it's not my fault that they forgot to remove expired discounts and should not have overcharged us for it and not do anything about it but argue back. Now I feel so bad for encouraging my friend to buy the cup noodle when he initially didn't even want to eat it. This lady was so uncooperative and unapologetic so I just left angrily without being compensated whatsoever.
I hope the 7/11 managers can remind their staff to remove discounts on time and be accountable for their mistakes.

I recently stayed at Spacepod Singapore and was thoroughly impressed by the entire experience. The pod concept is both futuristic and highly practical, offering a perfect blend of privacy, comfort, and affordability. The space was exceptionally clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully designed with amenities like charging ports, ventilation, and ambient lighting.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, making check-in smooth and providing great local tips. The location was very convenient—close to MRT stations, food spots, and popular attractions. Whether you're a solo traveler, digital nomad, or just looking for a unique stay, Spacepod is a fantastic choice.

But Mincent Car Workshop has already won me over with my previous visits.

Although the team is pretty new, and the mechanics are young. Their expertise is far beyond their age. Ah Kuan has a very high standard of work, and is able to find the root cause of issues very easily. When an engine rebuild is done, he does a stand-by bed standard of placing parts so that nothing is missed out. The other 2 mechanics are also attentive to details, and will clarify any issues you report.

Being my 4th visit so far, they have saved me quite alot of money by finding out the actual real root cause, instead of just making you replace everything like some workshops do....

Solutions provided are well thought out and they are linked up with the Malaysia branches so parts can be easily sourced even for old cars. Reasonable pricing, service is unrivalled

Price is $24/hr for large room (can pack 6-9 ppl)

Misses : Room not exactly soundproof - Noise isolation is not the best. The next room singing can be heard.

Neighborhood feel in terms of place vibes. Don't have too much expectations for the decor and grandiose.

Overall: A decent karaoke.",en,2 years ago,2023-01-27T17:54:32.450875Z,Chris T

When I sent my car in, I was attended to by Jing Rong who is down-to-earth, no drama, explaining the repair process clearly. The price quoted is much cheaper than 2 other places that I asked, where they acted like my damage was irreparable and needed replacement parts. Jing Rong simply stated what he could and could not do, and how much it costed, which was a very reasonable price. The car came back good as new and I knew this was the place I would go to if I ever needed another repair.

Now in 2025, two of my car doors got damaged. Jing Rong attended to me again, was transparent and prompt in giving me the quotation. No up-sell, and updated me with realistic turnaround time. Bonus, he was attentive and reminded me to take my valuables with me, but I still forgot some things, so I texted him to help me with safekeeping and he was ever so patient and helpful. They also accept Paywave which is great. I would highly recommend if you need your car body repair done.

I also couldn’t decide between product A and B, and he gave me very practical advice! Later on, I returned to the store to make the purchase, and I was very satisfied with my choice—thanks to Pin’s help and suggestions!

I’ve been to several other, even larger, Apple stores before, but I’ve never met a staff member as knowledgeable, attentive, and helpful about Apple products as Pin. I feel truly fortunate to have met him at this branch.

Just last week, I experienced another issue with my phone and made a point to return to the same store. Pin happened to be there again, and as always, he patiently helped me understand the issue so I could try to resolve it before deciding on the next step.

I sincerely hope that all Apple stores will have staff members like Pin—knowledgeable, warm, and detail-oriented. It would definitely make customers feel more at ease and ensure a long-term, trustworthy, and enjoyable shopping experience!",en,2 months ago,2025-06-24T06:23:47.090105220Z,ps k

Location: 3/5

I managed to book this hotel at a super affordable promotional rate! To my surprise, the price included a private bathroom — and even room cleaning service, which was unexpected!

There’s also a bar in the hotel, perfect for relaxing after a long day out. Plus, the hotel provides a public drinking water dispenser — I really appreciated that!

The only downside is that it takes about a 10-minute walk to the nearest MRT station. However, for those who take the bus, the bus stop is very close by. The room isn’t particularly big, but for RM200 a night, I dare you to compare — you won’t easily find another hotel offering a private bathroom and a double bed at this price.

I went to the cashier and saw the price so I said it's okay and I walked away. No issues so far. Slow day, no queue or anything.

When I am almost at the door the other staff calls after me ""madam when you don't want something you have to TELL ME!!"". This staff is not even the one at the cashier so out of nowhere this guy is shouting at me?? How can shout at customer?? So rude!! I left the cashier so long alr also the cashier no problem how come this staff can suddenly shout??

I was looking for something that is worth the buy and will compliment as a gift, as we know gold price is pretty high now in the market. I was assisted by your colleague Alex, and Im truly satisfied with my purchase. He really went the extra mile to get me what i was really looking for, at an affordable rate. It was in my mind, with my limited words he truly provided me with what i wanted. He was very helpful, kind and patient. I am very satisfied with his service and we need such people in this service industry to cater and help us with our purchase. Feeling very contented with my purchase. Great work Alex and Thank you so much for assisting me.

Lovely joint. If you are like me working in Singapore, and you need a peaceful, tranquil, and quiet start to your day, here’s the place.

All drinks are double shots. For mild coffee drinkers like myself, the chocolate and mocha are good options! There is sweet treat call “Chocolate Twist”. It’s perfect for ladies, as the pastry is rightly sized for our lips size and tummy.

They also have a selection of beans to choose from with notes written. The people are warm. Think this will be our new drink place and recharge in this hectic city.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-27T00:36:18.129252035Z,Michelle Tan

I will take back my things and never come back here ever again. Very very very bad experience here.",en,a year ago,2024-08-16T03:48:09.979292Z,Isaac Han

Miss Sally was very friendly and showed great customer service and explained with clarity.
Variety is less, 916 gold price much higher than market price. But there's no MC nor GST charges. Therefore when calculate with other jewelry shops, its still cheaper and you get to save more.
There's an option to pay via 3 month installment with no interest fee..
If more than 3 month then there's 0.7% interest added (which is reasonable).
Can walk in to pay any date within the month, flexible.

Good value for the deal.

The hours may say 24 hours on Google but that’s not how it is in real life. Some of the stalls we wanted to try closed earlier. This location is very touristy and became very popular after Crazy Rich Asians. I’ll summarize the food that we tried. Overall, it’s about a 3.5-4. You can find some good stalls here. One thing to mention is that you have to take your trays and used dishes to the designated areas. Sorry to say but way too many white Americans tend not to do this. This is why Americans get a bad reputation.

-Best satay 3.5 - we got a mix. The prawns were very tasty. Chicken was good. Some of the beef was a bit dry.

-Ming Kee Roasted 5 - I got the signature (roasted duck with roasted pork). I loved this dish. It was made fresh. The duck and pork were both very tender and succulent. It tasted even better with the rice. I recommend stopping here.

Fried Buns 5 - I ordered the Shanghai steamed dumplings and Shanghai dumplings in chili oil. They were both excellent. Chili oil is not spicy at all. Dumplings were not dry and had a good flavor.

-Noodles in fish soup 5 - it was pretty good if you don’t mind the fish taste. Noodles were chewy. Flavorful dish.

-Ice kacang 3 - it was pretty much like flavored shaved ice, nothing special. The Korean shaved ice is better.

-Golden Shoe hokkien mee 1 - the oyster omelette was really bad. There were more burnt pieces than actual oysters. Somehow they ran out of fried carrot cake.

-Chicken wings 5 - Very juicy. A lot better than the oyster omelette.",en,a month ago,2025-07-25T06:00:36.214416694Z,Nicholas P

A cup of iced milo now costs $3.50, cai fan with 2 meats 1 veg $6.40, and chicken rice set $8 - all a sharp increase from before the renovation with no improvements in taste or dining atmosphere.

auntie pulled up the nets payment QR code and when showed her my voucher to redeem, she began grumbling and saying that she had asked me earlier if i wanted to use voucher (which i stated upfront). she grumbled multiple times that it would take very long to cancel the transaction.

The iced coconut latter was made with coconut milk, which made it even more creamy and indulgent. It wasn't over-bearing and I could still taste the coffee.

I finally visited their physical shop for an afternoon coffee break. The latte did not disappoint. Cowpresso delivered that perfect cup of latte, presented with beautiful latte art. And the food was equally enjoyable.

The cafe provides ample seats, with 3 distinct sections to choose from. A small selection of accessories and beans are available off the shelves. While the bulk of the products are displayed behind glass doors, and required an appointment to view.

Tiffany's friendly and cheerful personality makes you feel at ease.
The ear cleaning was very thorough, making sure she never left any spot unchecked.
Since it was my first time with her, she keeps on checking on the process to ensure that I am in no being uncomfortable or having any pain.
i requested more time for ear cleaning that we barely have enough for a massage.

The bar itself has a charming colonial vibe with vintage decor, rattan fans on the ceiling, and a relaxed, old-school atmosphere that makes you feel like you’ve stepped back in time. It’s the kind of place where you don’t need to rush just sit back, soak in the history, and enjoy the moment.

Of course, the highlight here is the original Singapore Sling. It’s a sweet, slightly tangy cocktail with hints of cherry, pineapple, and herbal undertones. Very refreshing, light, and surprisingly easy to drink which I can totally see why it became world-famous. It’s not just a drink, it’s part of Singapore’s cultural story.

Another quirky and fun detail is the tradition of throwing peanut shells on the floor, one of the only places in Singapore where littering is allowed (and encouraged) lol

Yes, the drink is a bit pricey (around SGD 37), but you’re paying for the experience as much as the cocktail itself and it’s worth every dollar for the atmosphere, service, and taste.

Tip: Go during the quieter hours if you want to really enjoy the ambiance without the crowds.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-24T13:57:13.580841Z,Panggg S.

When my wife and I arrived at the store, it was late in the evening and relatively quiet. We appreciated that the sales staff noticed us but gave us some time to settle in and browse comfortably before approaching. This thoughtful approach stood out to us, especially since my wife usually prefers not to be approached too quickly.

We were interested in a gold bangle, and Olivia assisted us throughout the process with professionalism, politeness, and well-mannered service. She even suggested other designs that paired well with the bangle we were considering.

Thanks to Olivia’s helpful recommendations, we ended up purchasing the gold bangle along with a matching ring she suggested. We’re extremely happy with her service—she was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.

I highly recommend Top Cash Little India—and particularly Olivia—to anyone looking for gold jewelry.

Thank you for providing us with such a wonderful shopping experience! :)",en,8 months ago,2024-12-22T11:01:12.670034Z,Wei Ming Khor

Only 2 toilets and 2 showers in the hostel? And they are directly next to the common area. So uncomfortable. No place for your luggage in the room so you need to storage everything you have in the open common area? Makes no sense. They have a lot of beds in 1 room and there is no place for your stuff. Also in the shower no place to put your towel or clothes.

Only good thing is the mattresses and pilow are very comfortable and there is a curtain. And the location is near the subway and bus. But damn, I've never spent so much money on a hostel this uncomfortable before.",en,3 weeks ago,2025-08-07T00:21:55.634770310Z,Roos Delsing

- good customer service - staff were always responsive via email, attentive at front desk, and the managing boss is always in attendance
- location is walking distance to Little India, MRT and buses
- rooms have air conditioning
- cheap
- luggage can be held on check-in and check-out
- keyed lockers are available at minimum cost - $2 deposit/$1 rental

(-)'s:
- the other reviews already describe the ambience of this place well - in all honesty, I feel that this place has given up its expectation of being a reputable accommodation, and accepted that its place in the ecosystem is as a halfway house for migrant workers, or as a homeless shelter. These reviews appear to have said similar for years, thus my conclusion.
- there is a laissez-faire attitude to ground rules in this place (management don't set firmly, and there's no enforcement) and the overall design has much to be desired. Many areas have fallen into disrepair. Don't come with expectations of comfort or a relaxed stay. This is not the place.
- the dorms are verging on overcrowded (8 pax dorm). The rotating door of travellers has led to disrepair, and clearly some pest problems - bed bugs, cockroaches, mice all evident. The corridors are stacked with disused bedding, furniture - havens for bed bugs, termites to nest and significant fire hazards. Clean it up. The linen had black markings (bed bugs). Wet, damp, dirty or sweaty clothing hangs from beds leading to room hygiene issues.
- surely there are some amenities that the hostel can afford to provide at no added cost like soap or shampoo dispensers in the shower? Just small improvements that could lead to a much better ambience and guest behaviours.
- the demographic of tenants is generally long-term stay migrant workers from the subcontinent. There is little respect for sleep, other travellers or local culture - phone calls and chit-chat in the room take place at all hours. It is what it is, get comfortable. I cannot recommend this place for female travellers.
- dorm rooms will remain unlocked, secure keyed lockers are the main security for personal items
- acknowledging that there is a dearth of low-cost accommodation options for travellers in Singapore, this place fills a role - but some reflective self-assessment is overdue as to whether it meets an adequate level of hospitality standards.",en,a year ago,2024-07-14T09:54:03.691013Z,Christopher Chong

Service is good, and the food is both interesting and top notch.

We were seated at an outdoor table conveniently located right next to the playground, which was great for families with young children. However, do note that the outdoor area had some mosquitoes, so insect repellent might come in handy.

We ordered a variety of dishes to share – the salmon steak, wagyu burger, white clams in white sauce, aglio olio with prawns, cornflake chicken breast, and the sweet & sour cauliflower. They also offer a kids’ menu, which includes a main and drink – a thoughtful touch for families.

Unfortunately, while the food was decent, the service left much to be desired. It appeared that only one service staff was managing the floor, which resulted in a long wait for drinks and multiple reminders needed for cutlery, condiments, and basic requests.

Overall, the experience was underwhelming, and while the location is great for families, we’re unlikely to return given the slow service.",en,a month ago,2025-07-20T13:41:01.719171368Z,мιѕѕувєlα2828

✳️ Unit 01-51, One-North Residences,
9 One-north Gateway, Singapore 138643

🟢 Nestled away in the verdant & lush vicinity of One-North Residences, Jimmy Monkey Cafe is a hidden gem delight that blends laid-back charm with a casual cafe culture vibe.

🟦  The cafe is situated at the foot of a block of low-rise condominium residences.

✳️ This small cafe offers a tranquil escape that feels far removed from the city’s buzz—yet it remains accessible.✔️ The cafe is just a short walk from One-North MRT station.

⚫️ The decor is industrial-chic style — think exposed brick, polished concrete, and warm wood tones offset by eclectic vintage accents.

🔵 Service here is friendly & casual. The staff here strikes a fine balance between pleasant hospitality and efficient operation.

🟠  The cafe latte here is smooth and rich with a full-bodied espresso base—clearly well crafted.  ▪︎ Coffee is served from an exclusive hand-crafted Slayer Machine.

🟫 The grilled cheese sandwich was hearty and satisfying, served warm with just the right crunch. It’s comfort food done well.

🟧 The Warehouse Hotel
320 Havelock Road
Singapore 169628

🟫  The Warehouse Lobby Bar at the Warehouse Hotel at Havelock Road is a stylish and industrial-chic bar that serves up craft cocktails in a unique and atmospheric setting.

🟧The lobby bar is situated in a beautifully restored 19th-century warehouse (built in 1895), with exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and polished concrete floors. The decor is modern and sleek, with comfortable & plush sofa seating areas and a lively bar counter.

🔵 The drink menu is creative and extensive, with a focus on handcrafted cocktails. The bar also serves a selection of wine, beer, and champagne.

🟨 We ordered 2 cups of Hot Cafe Latte and were served by Isabelle, a very polite, nice and cheerful lady.🩷 Because of Isabelle's great & empathetic attitude, I am giving the Warehouse Lobby Bar 5 stars.

⬛️ Overall, the Warehouse Lobby Bar is a great spot to relax and unwind with friends or family, and take in the stylish and historic surroundings.

They serve really good coffee at an affordable price (there’s drip coffee too)! I’ve tried their cakes, macrons and cookies. They are the best keto-friendly desserts I’ve tried - Cakes were moist and flavourful, cookies paired perfectly with coffee and most importantly they were all not too sweet! (No taste of artificial sweeteners either).
The owner, Krystal, is also one of the sweetest and friendliest people I’ve met. She’s passionate in the work she does and we have great conversations (not to mention we get to meet her goldie, Tokyo). They surely brighten my day after long hours in the lab.

They are very accommodating and make out dining experience a very joyous one! I love the vibe here, cool weather  and with nice band singing some oldies. The food is good too and reasonably priced.

I regret not getting the wait staff's name as his professionalism and attentive service made all the difference dining here. Appreciated his recommendations and also highlighting the promotions available. Their SG60 promotion, second main at $6 is an offer too good to pass up. Sadly they didn't have the strawberry shortcake in the large slice version as I previously had and came back for.

I had the garden pesto orecchiette. Decent portion topped with lots of cheese, toasted pine nuts and hearty drizzle of olive oil. Pesto is heavy on garlic but balanced the flavours well. As a meat lover, I would still recommend this vegetarian option.

Next up, was the Angus rump cap steak. It came with a side of mash and mushrooms. I ate two slices and did not enjoy this at all. Staff came to check in on me and I shared that the steak lacked any seasoning. There was also a strip of gristle on every slice except the edge piece I started with. I was initially planning on just leaving the steak but he offered to return it to the kitchen for feedback. Chef mentioned this particular cut was as such and he could redo it with more seasoning on the side. I decided to try the pork ribs which was initially recommended by staff. It turned out to be a good option. The sweet grilled white corn that came as a side is delicious! Pipping hot fries and a slab of tender pork ribs with it's meat falling off the bone.

Takeaway two of their cakes and will come back when their regular strawberry shortcake slices are available again. Their pulled pork pizza did sound interesting as well. Thank you for the lovely evening dining here, it was a much needed respite.

Recommended for date nights. It's lovely in the evenings when the lights come on.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-14T13:57:27.391955086Z,Fel Ong

The location, perched atop Telok Blangah Hill, provides a tranquil escape with lush greenery surrounding the historic building. While the serene setting is a definite plus, it's worth noting that the bar is not the most accessible via public transport, so planning for private transport or a taxi is advisable.

Despite the slightly secluded locale, the warm welcome from the staff immediately makes you feel at ease. Their service was not only friendly but also remarkably prompt. We were impressed by how quickly both our food and drinks arrived at the table.

Speaking of the offerings, the menu boasts a delightful array of dishes. The truffle carbonara pasta was rich and decadent, while the chilli crab pasta offered a flavorful local twist with a pleasant hint of spice. The ribs were tender and satisfying, and the pulled pork pizza was packed with delicious, smoky flavor. Even the side dishes impressed, particularly the salted egg fries, which truly stood out as some of the best fries I've had – perfectly crispy with a luscious salted egg coating. To top it off, their drink promotion of 2 for $20 offers great value.

Overall, 1918 Heritage Bar at Alkaff Mansion delivers a memorable dining experience with tasty food, efficient and friendly service, and a charming ambience. While its hilltop location might require a bit more effort to reach, the overall experience makes it well worth the journey.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-18T03:16:54.114379Z,Joe Soh

Thanks Ms SG, counter cashier for good explanation as I'm a ""high roller"", she ensure that I have understood which top up and promotion , lucky draw, points redemption etc. really appreciate the assistance from them.
However, I would like to point out is that the claw machine is really hard to get it. I don't feel like there's any ""guaranteed claw chance"" 保夹, I've spent almost $100 on a single blinbox claw machine and it's to no avail. None of the box I can manage to claw it... Management should look into this.
While I enjoy the thrills and dopamine flows like roller coaster 🎢 but many claw machines really feel like a scam for money.
I have played in other arcade brands like the one in hougang mall, if the customer cannot get a single plushie/ blindbox, just inform the staff and they will ask which one is your favourite, but it's limited choice, can get a complimentary one to ensure there is no disappoinment among the customers.

During a recent visit, the highlight was a plate of Hokkien Mee, which retained the wok hei aroma and balanced seafood richness that fans of the original centre would recognize. The noodles were well-braised, with a generous mix of prawns and squid, and came with a sambal that was both smoky and sharp. Despite the change in location, the quality and character of the dish remain impressively intact.

For dessert, the Ice Kachang offered a refreshing counterpoint. It came tall and finely shaved, with a classic mix of red beans, attap seeds, jelly, and sweet corn, topped with syrup that didn’t overwhelm. The texture and taste were reminiscent of hawker desserts from an earlier era — unpretentious and satisfying.

While the market can feel stuffy, especially during lunchtime, this is an understandable trade-off given its temporary structure and heavy foot traffic. Ventilation fans are in place, but visitors might prefer to come earlier in the day or later in the afternoon for a more comfortable experience.

Despite the spatial limitations, the market maintains a familiar charm. Seating is reasonably ample, the place is kept clean, and stallholders continue to serve food with the same energy and pride as before. For those who frequented the old Bukit Timah Market, the new setup offers continuity — not just in taste, but in spirit.

For anyone looking to revisit old favourites or explore enduring hawker craft, the Jalan Seh Chuan site is well worth the trip.",en,a month ago,2025-07-22T10:34:16.085362685Z,Chong Tee Lim

Damn Good Coffee is a good drink, but when they lifted the lid of the Smoky Negroni, there was no smoke. So it was a Negroni.   Food was presented well, but not very good.  Would definitely not recommend the duck croquettes. The prawns were adequate.
The big downside is that there is nothing special about the atmosphere and hotel guests transit through on way to pool, restaurant, and other places. So hard to enjoy drinks when a couple kids come shrieking through.
Overall, I would not recommend this bar.  Definitely only for those staying at the hotel and even then, not sure I would get drinks there.",en,10 months ago,2024-10-18T11:26:58.718595Z,M M

Club Amairo was very exclusive among all the others club that i had went. Regardless to say of their services , all the ladies were so gorgeous.

On the other hand, unlike other club ,bottles purchased is valid for 6 months
It's worth of  what you spend.

The room is so comfortable with the best sofa and superb karaoke system. I will be definitely comes to the club again and im willing to spent a lot because Club Amairo is the most exclusive and best Japenese Club in Singapore!

We started with the oysters ($3 per piece, with a minimum order of six). They were relatively plump and fresh enough to enjoy. For the mains, I had the chicken schnitzel, which was alright but nothing to rave about. The potato wedges were a pleasant surprise—well-seasoned and not soggy, just the way they should be.

Unfortunately, the rosti was a letdown. It came out cold, hard, and rather tasteless, which was disappointing considering it’s typically a comforting, crispy dish.

That said, Brotzeit still serves as a good spot to hang out and grab a drink with friends, especially if you’re not expecting mind-blowing food. It's more about the vibes and casual dining here than a standout culinary experience.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-20T13:24:25.965293Z,Ming Shen Tham

Really bad service. Manager is not around and there is only one staff. He was constantly not there and we had to wait 15mins every-time he went for his toilet break. I spent $100 just to get a certain card in the Pokémon game however it ran out of cards and it was still in there. The staff said they ran out of action card which is like huh? Each box supposed to have one and you ran out but you have a full box of refill around? He proceeded to ask us to play another but come on the card isn’t on the other machine. What a waste of money and time, do not recommend this place to others. I even requested for a time frame for it to be fixed and I can come back, nothing was given. I have worked with mezastar before and each refill box comes with an action card. So how can the stock not tally?",en,a week ago,2025-08-21T08:31:03.544512532Z,Azzo K

Decent variety of your run of the mill witbiers, though their relatively more special in-house brew, the Helles, was out the night we visited

Ok:
- Sausage platter. Sausages were okay, if a little salty and not really having enough bite. Mash was way too runny. Sauerkraut out of a jar.

I am writing to express my deepest appreciation for the exceptional service provided by Mr. Nasir from Quick Lane who serves at Sime Darby / Vantage Automotive Ltd at Alexandra .

On 21st July 2025 at 4:30 PM , my car broke down in my estate carpark. In this stressful situation, I contacted Mr. Nasir, who responded promptly and patiently .He expertly guided me through identifying potential causes of the breakdown, demonstrating remarkable knowledge and professionalism. His calm and reassuring approach immediately gave me peace of mind.

My vehicle was towed to the Quick Lane workshop at Alexandra, where Mr. Nasir continued to provide outstanding support. He kept me informed throughout the diagnostic process and promptly explained the issue of my car failure was due to the gear lever cable assembly had failed, preventing the engine from starting.

Despite the workshop being exceptionally busy with numerous maintenance services , Mr. Nasir coordinate very well with his technical team and repaired my car efficiently, replacing the new gear lever cable assembly and my car was tested ok . He also proactively followed up on my car scheduled routine service, ensuring I was reminded and well-informed.

Mr. Nasir’s expertise, dedication, and customer-centric attitude truly exceeded my expectations. I am thoroughly delighted with his excellent service.

I believed Mr. Nasir for his excellence , he embodies the highest standards of Quick Lane commitment to customer care.

I’ve been servicing my car with Quicklane for over 9 years because they always push me into buying their servicing packages — which ties me down to them. In the early years, before they onboarded BYD, their servicing standards were excellent and I was genuinely happy, which is why I kept buying their packages. But even with a package, I always seemed to incur extra charges here and there.

Since they started handling BYD, everything has gone downhill. The CSAs don’t bother replying to messages, and when they finally do, the service attitude is shockingly poor.

My most recent experience was the last straw:
•	After sending my car in for servicing, I had to tow it off the highway just 2 days later.
•	When they couldn’t identify the issue, their “solution” was simply to replace parts at my cost. Convenient, isn’t it?
•	My Bluetooth system issue has dragged on forever — their answer? Replace the entire radio system! What nonsense.
•	Within the SAME month of servicing, my engine light came on. When I asked why this happened right after servicing, they had no proper explanation and instead told me to come down for a diagnostic test — and pay another $70 for it.

Before sending the car in, I never had these issues. Now I’m left with even more problems, extra bills, and no accountability from them.",en,a week ago,2025-08-21T02:45:41.992994828Z,Keith Chua

The service was good as well, before the session ended there’s a friendly reminder of how many times is left before the session officially ends.

It is exactly like the reviews I’ve seen on here before going and it is expected. However, I do think it is much more affordable to go there between the time range of 12pm to 6pm as after 6pm or a few mins before 6pm the price would increase and no offers will be available🥹

Firstly, the room we were given was much smaller than what was shown in the photos, and it did not meet our expectations. We had also placed an early order for 串串 and specifically requested for it to be non-spicy. However, we were later informed that the kitchen could only prepare a ""small spicy"" version. Despite expressing our concern, we were left with no choice. When the food finally arrived, it was extremely spicy and inedible for us, resulting in unnecessary food wastage.

Due to this, we had to order additional food, which took a long time to be served. We also extended our room for another hour to continue our session. Time seemed to pass quickly, and before we could properly finish, a staff member came to inform us that our time was up and that there were no further extensions available due to full bookings. While we were packing our belongings, the staff stood by and watched, making us feel rushed and uncomfortable, as though they were afraid we would not leave.

Overall, the service was poor and disappointing. We spent a significant amount of money expecting to enjoy ourselves, but the experience left us feeling very dissatisfied. Unfortunately, I do not intend to return, nor would I recommend this KTV to others.",en,3 weeks ago,2025-08-02T23:29:50.335805201Z,Jessie Lim

Look at the details of their poor ratings and you see the consistency. Tried emailing to the company, and it does not get through at all.

(1) Tokens get stuck at the dispenser machine, went to the counter and red shirt staff (3 of them there) told us to scan QR code and wait for blue shirt staff (tech) who didn't turn up. It was around 1115am at that time with no customers around. Went back to counter to ask, red shirt staff just stood there and told us to look for blue short staff. Went 1 round and was unable to find the blue shirt staff. Went back to counter and asked red shirt staff, one of whom then went to the small office right behind their counter to get the blue shirt staff out. What is this??? Crap service response standard, clearly a ""can't be bothered"" attitude shown here. All of them were standing at the counter chillax-ing.
(2) Blue shirt staff said tokens not topped up at the dispenser machine.
(3) Then a play machine didn't work even after tokens were inserted. We scanned the QR code and same thing happened again, blue shirt staff didn't turn up and left us waiting there. At this point in time, there is less than 10 customers. Went to counter again, same old crap from the staff. Approached another blue shirt staff who told us to wait.

We had tried the Century Square outlet and the same issues were  encountered. Poor service response standard overall. So pls do not be bothered to patronize them. We WILL NOT be going to any of these outlets anymore.

Overall, the experience was very pleasant, although there are a few aspects to consider.

ROOM:
The capsules do not have doors, so much like in a typical hostel, you can hear everything happening around you. Additionally, the capsule structure is quite noisy; any movement causes creaking sounds that could disturb your roommates.

That said, the setup was otherwise great. Each capsule includes a power outlet, RGB lighting, a fan system, and the room has air conditioning.

SERVICE:
The service was excellent.
The staff were friendly and quick to respond to requests. We asked for an extra blanket and a fresh towel, and both were provided promptly.

Breakfast is included, though it’s simple: toasted bread with butter, chocolate spread, or peanut butter. Tea and coffee are available 24/7, which is a nice touch.

LOCATION:
The location is ideal for exploring the city. The metro station is just a 5-minute walk away, and both Little India and Chinatown can be reached on foot within a short time.",en,a month ago,2025-07-09T14:25:26.672714995Z,Michele Drigo

Today no photo as we were overwhelmed by the number of stall will very unique food. Also the pricing is very reasonable. The stall were very friendly, the place is a bit warm (got lot of fan) but very lively.
2nd time today, we took photo of the many staircase leading to the food stall, it is impossible for wheelchair to have a meal here. We wanted to try other stall but in the end we have the Malay food again. It was around 8+ and was very surprised by the scarcity of the crowd. With so many nice food stall it should be crowded. Will come again to try other stall.
Feb25, today try the yuan yong YTF SOUP, not as good as I try the first time, the noodle is a bit hard (Sarawak kolo mee). Left with disappointment. But will try again to be fair.

The bridge connects seamlessly to the Southern Ridges trail, making it a great starting point for a scenic walk through lush parks and forests. The views from the bridge are lovely, especially in the evening when it’s illuminated with colorful LED lights.

While the area can get a bit warm during the day, the cool breeze and shaded sections along the trail make the walk enjoyable. It’s also relatively quiet, offering a peaceful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

Made a few calls before going down, and the boss Mr Yap was super patient and helpful, not pushy at all either.

My car issue was simple and easy, unlike other workshops who exaggerated the situation over the phone. The issue was fixed on the same day and at a super super affordable price. While waiting for my car to be fixed, the lady boss also offered some coffee and snacks which was a nice touch.

Everyone at the workshop was helpful, communicative and reassuring which is very important to a first time car buyer like me.

Tucked away in Singapore’s competitive cocktail scene, Martini Bar is a refined sanctuary for spirit enthusiasts. Its focus is on classic martinis and has an upscale vibe.

Ambience
The bar oozes sophistication with plush leather stools, gleaming glassware, and mood lighting that flatters both the drinks and the clientele. Seating at the bar is prime real estate, offering front-row views of the bartenders’ meticulous craft.

Service
Impeccable. Staff are attentive without hovering, knowledgeable without pretension, and quick to refill your glass before you notice it’s empty.

Food & Drink
The martinis are the undisputed stars—crisp, potent, and expertly balanced, with happy hour deals that justify indulgence. The cocktail menu respects classics while offering just enough twists to intrigue purists. The snacks are an afterthought: uninspired and pale next to the drinks.

Overall
Martini Bar excels as a temple to the art of the cocktail, with service and ambience to match. It is ideal for a pre-dinner drink or a debonair nightcap.

Upon arrival at midnight, the complete lack of signage for the establishment made finding it an exasperating experience.  Exhausted from travel, I finally located the place with the assistance of a helpful stranger – on the top floor of a building where even other tenants seemed unaware of its existence.

The frustration continued at the check-in.  There was no staffed front desk, and the information provided by the staff regarding check-in details was incomplete and ultimately unusable. Two other guests faced similar issues, struggling with incorrect access codes. Thankfully, another guest  assisted us in deciphering the unclear instructions, a process that consumed a frustrating thirty minutes.  Despite repeated attempts to reach staff through the Agoda app, no assistance was provided.

The deficiencies continued within the capsule room itself. The extreme lack of ventilation and absence of at least a small fan inside the capsule made for an uncomfortably hot environment. Even with the curtain partially open for a semblance of air circulation, the temperature remained stifling.  As if the physical discomfort wasn't enough, the night was plagued by excessive noise. Loud karaoke music from a nearby bar echoed through the walls throughout the early hours, hindering sleep. Furthermore, the capsule design offered minimal soundproofing, allowing even minor noises from other guests to easily disrupt the tranquility of the room.

The final indignity came in the form of the shared bathroom. Located outside the hotel itself, it was a dirty and inconvenient communal facility.  This unsanitary situation was the final straw.

The room is clean and spacious. I love how the staff is so helpful if I want to change my bedsheet or my towels, they will do it immediately.

The service here is super nice and friendly. Have a good time staying, especially thanks to Fikri! He is so helpful and friendly during my stay. The other staff are nice as well.

Overall, I love this hostel. Have been coming back multiple times whenever I visit Singapore.

Just one minus point is the bar upstairs, yet they are working on this problems (in which I appreciate since they listen to customers ideas and opinions).",en,a year ago,2024-05-08T08:05:21.284590Z,Kristen Ho

Treatment is quite effective but pricing is very unorthodox.

There's a mandatory consultation fee ($40), and acupuncture starts *from* $90. For example, if the treatment requires leaving the needle in for a longer period of time, or if more needles are added for other parts, then it will count as another separate treatment, causing the price to double/triple accordingly. A simple straightforward treatment session can very easily chalk up to $150-$200, which is mind-boggling.

Highly recommend any future patrons to double/triple check if one is okay with this sort of pricing system *before* accepting treatment.

Personally, I DO NOT recommend this place if this way of pricing persists. There are equally good TCM clinics elsewhere that charge treatments in a more transparent and reasonable way.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-17T13:27:50.383941Z,Leo Tan

After my workouts at True Fitness, I usually come here for groceries and often buy a roasted chicken from the counter. The staff have always been helpful — most of them willingly cut the chicken into 4 pieces for me upon request.

However, I have repeatedly encountered poor service from one staff member named Lily. On several occasions, she refused to cut the chicken, giving various reasons — such as “the chicken is on sale” or “it’s the weekend and there are too many customers.” This has happened multiple times, yet her colleagues have always been able to provide the same service without issue.

When I raised this with the store manager, Mr. Puah, he confirmed that cutting the chicken is part of their service, regardless of whether it is on sale or how busy it is. I hope top management will address this inconsistency so that customers can enjoy a consistent level of service from all staff members.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-12T06:24:13.254888785Z,Cyril Goh

A few weeks ago, someone had spilled a drink on the floor. As I was pushing a trolley and unknowingly approached the area, this staff member stood nearby and abruptly shouted “Oi!” before pointing at the spill. His expression was extremely hostile!
almost as if to say, “Are you blind?” It was unnecessarily aggressive and humiliating.

On another occasion, I witnessed him act rudely toward a couple browsing at the bakery section. He arrived with multiple carts and attempted to push through a narrow space without saying “Excuse me” or asking politely. Instead, he glared at the couple with an exaggerated, wide-eyed stare, silently pressuring them to move. Startled, they quickly stepped aside. It was uncomfortable to witness.

Later, when I went to pay for my items, I told the cashier that I’d return shortly to grab a few more packs of blueberries. I placed my cart aside temporarily. This same staff member then ordered me to push my cart over and return to the bakery area, even though I had already informed the cashier of my plan. It felt controlling and unnecessary.

Fortunately, another staff member noticed and kindly offered to help move my cart. His helpful attitude stood in stark contrast to the rude behavior I’ve described.

Staff training and professionalism are essential to the shopping experience. Customers should never feel intimidated or disrespected. I sincerely hope CS Fresh takes this feedback seriously and addresses this individual’s behavior appropriately.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-30T14:13:43.007892Z,Wynn Li

Visited Helen姊 since May for my condition - raised cancer markers. From end of 2023 to early 2024, I’ve was following up with a specialist for regular blood test but the level kept increasing exponentially, but there were no significant findings via CT scans.

After going for treatments from May till August, the blood test showed a significant 30% drop in the levels.

The staff is nice and friendly, place looks clean but there was a mosquito under our seats when we visited this restaurant (indoor seat).

- taste like added MSG. We can feel the truffle after swallowing but is very salty and can't taste the mushroom at all 😂 so not the usual mushroom soup we had. First time seeing oil on top of mushroom soup, suspecting if it's truffle oil? Not sure. And the garlic bread is hard to bite, need to dip inside the soup and wait for it to turn soft.

I came on a Friday evening with a friend. We had a plate of fries and a shepherd's pie, along with 2 ciders and 2 pints of beers.

Firstly, I wish there were half pint options available. The menu only has full pints shown.

Secondly, we ordered fries to share and then decided to get the shepherd's pie later on. As you can see, the shepherd's pie also came with fries. In the menu it is indicated that she shepherd's pie comes with mash potato (it does). I wish the staff had informed us that there is another portion of fries coming or that they might've given us the option to swap out the fries that came with the shepherd's pie. I would've been very impressed if this was the level of service.

We found that for $19.90 the portion of shepherd's pie is extremely small. Not because we were sharing, it was just a very tiny serving. Taste was great, just don't feel that it is worth the $19.90++ price.

The worst karaoke experience ever

It’s a Friday night and we arrived at this karaoke place around 9 PM and were given a room that had apparently already started at 9, which we didn’t mind. Not realizing it was a bar setting, we made the mistake of bringing our own drinks. Shortly after starting our session, the 1st female staff member entered to inform us that outside drinks weren’t allowed. We apologized, explained it was our first time there, and we would order food and drinks from the venue. She was understanding and told us not to do it again.

However, things quickly turned ridiculous. Within the next 5 minutes, a 2nd female staff member came in to repeat the same message. We again apologized and reiterated that we had placed orders with them.

Then, less than 2 minutes later, a 3rd male staff member entered to tell us again that outside drinks weren’t allowed and warned he’d come back to check. We complied and placed the drinks into a paper bag. But before even a minute had passed, a fourth staff member entered, this time asking to confiscate our drinks and store them at the counter. We refused, as the drinks were already opened and half-consumed — we had no idea what might happen to them once out of our sight.

Throughout the entire 2-hour session, staff continued to peek into our room repeatedly, making us feel like we were under surveillance. It felt less like a karaoke session and more like being in a monitored holding cell. Aren’t they busy on a Friday night, why would they do it to such extent?

If outside drinks are strictly prohibited, the staff could have simply refused us entry or asked us to leave at the start. Instead, they allowed us in, took our card, and then spent the rest of the time interrupting and policing us, ruining what should have been an enjoyable night.

Absolutely terrible service. I would give zero stars if I could. Avoid this place at all costs",en,a month ago,2025-07-18T18:28:28.477196180Z,Ng XT

What truly sets this café apart is the warm, friendly service. The baristas were incredibly knowledgeable and happy to recommend beverages based on our preferences. You can tell they’re passionate about their craft.

The ambience is another win: authentic raw nofrills cafe, and plenty of natural light make it a great spot to chill, catch up on work, or meet friends.

We also shared a slice of their homemade banana, lemon cake, which was divine—moist, fragrant, and not too sweet. I’ll definitely be coming back to try their other small bakes items.

We were willing to pay the price for the dolphin experience because we know it costs money to upkeep the place, give dolphins good food (I see they are always feeding them well) etc.

BUT the overall experience was not good. The toilets are not in the best condition. As an observer, I was bitten ferociously by mosquitoes while waiting for my family to finish their experience with the dolphins. And the worst thing is, they did not provide any towels when the participants got out of the water. It was cold and we still had to listen to the debrief... and wait, listen to their sales pitch for the photographs.

The photographs are such a rip-off, but guess what - we end up having to buy it because the staff are extremely strict about not bringing in your own cameras or phones. 2 photos that cost close to $170. It was the cheapest deal that we could find. The quality of the photos aren't even that great and the photo frame is flimsy.

Ideally we would have loved to dive in for the full experience but the Dolphin Encounter was the only option for our young boy. Nevertheless, I myself have never had the opportunity to get so up close with a dolphin before so this was all so special. Thanks dolphin trainer Jen Chai for facilitating this safe and fun encounter! 🙏🏻 The staff know all the individual dolphins so well and we saw that the dolphins were very well taken care of. We really appreciate all Dolphin Island does for the dolphins and also visitors. Do be prepared to pay a sum for the professional photos and videos, as you are not allowed to bring your own phone or camera in for safety reasons (you will likely get wet even for the encounter). There are also two different ticket entires (you must book a slot in advance): one via Adventure Cove and the other via SEA Aquarium, we chose the latter which was a wonderful experience for the family too.

On Tuesday, my husband and I saw a  Zojirushi Glass Vacuum Carafe that we liked in Best Denki Clementi Mall.

The female staff that served us earlier said it was the last one on the shelf and didn't have the box. We declined and asked if it was in stock at another branch. However, as she was about to check, she was stopped by another woman and asked about something. Seeing that she was entertaining that woman, we turned and went to another staff, who then summoned Mr. Manimara to assist us. He quickly found one in the system and transferred it to the Clementi Mall branch, saying he would notify me as soon as it arrived. Surprisingly, the product arrived a day earlier than expected. I'm so grateful for his efficient service. No wonder that day we saw an old lady walked in to thank him for his thoughtful service.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-14T11:41:53.275082923Z,Ying Ting Ng

Secondly, facility is old, but bed area is maintained clean to a decent level at this price. I had a good sleep as well. Bathroom is not clean but acceptable for this price.

Finally, for service, not so good. The lady with hijab is not pleasant to talk with, but acceptable at this price.

We were a group of colleagues visiting this bar after an academic event. We were the only customers, there were no DJs, and we had to take care of the music ourselves.

First, I saw the owner turning the volume down with an angry face. After a while, he started yelling at me in a very aggressive and insulting way in front of everyone just because I was taking a video of our own group dancing. He was so impolite and unprofessional that I'm sure it was the first time in my life that I've seen such a circus.

Apparently, he does not allow taking photos/videos at his bar. Since this is not a law in Singapore, I believe something not quite right is going on at this bar which made the owner so threatened and aggressive. I hope the authorities would take a look at what's going on at this place.

Couple of days later i went back as the sim card issue came up again due to my own fault of applying pressure on the phone in my pocket. but he did not charge me to fix it again as it was within 2 month warranty.

Today I went completely at my own fault of breaking my phone after smashing it. It was completely unrelated to the previous repair when he was finished, i asked how much and the technician recognized me and he said it fine.

I dont know his name but I WILL ALWAYS remember your kind gesture today. You sensed me in trouble and wanted to help me just like that. Thank you!

I was attended to by Jack who was very professional and courteous. He managed to diagnose the problem in a couple of minutes as a blown motherboard fuse and gave me a reasonable and transparent quotation to fix the problem.

3 days later, my iPhone is working as good as a brand new phone again! Jack was also very gracious to add in a free screen protector replacement for me as he had to remove the old one while disassembling my phone. The repair also came with a 3 month warranty.

✅
- Prices are competitive. Not far off from the Mr Mobile that is downstairs.
- Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Managed to get my LCD repaired and running on the same day. They take 10 - 30 mins for LCD repairs.
- Staff even threw in a new screen protector for me :)
- There’s a 3 months warranty included for repairs, so there’s some ease of mind if the phone gives you problems again after you have repaired it.

❌
- There was a slight hiccup where the initial LCD used was not compatible with my phone and there were still some glitchy/black spots on my phone.

Staff told me that he will get a compatible version sent in to the store later that day and to come back to get the phone fully repaired. Appreciated this arrangement because our phones are very essential to us in this day and age.

For the last couple years, I have been bringing my own grocery bags due to environment reason. Giant staffs are friendly and helpful, except for 1 person, ms. Huang or Shuang, one with short boyish hairstyle (I didn't get her surname). She has never assisted to pack my groceries whenever I bring my own shopping bags. She would only pack when I pass her my bags and ask for her help while I make payment or putting my cash into my wallet.

Never ever have I wanted to complain about her but base on my last experience is my last drawn with her. I asked her to help me to pack my groceries while I put my money back into my purse (I have pack half of it myself) and yet, she went ahead and process transaction for other customer. In the end, I pack by myself.

Other staffs usually help me pack my groceries into my bags without me asking for their help. That includes cashier staffs at FairPrice or Cold Storage.

I think, it is part of their respnsibilities to pack for their customer whethet they pay for plastic bag or using their own shopping bag. Unless Giants has a different policy.

If customer has to packed their own groceries when they bring their own shopping bag, might as well add in more self check out counters and please make sure self check out counters are working. The machines are not even working most of the days.

I hope Giant would take my feedback into consideration and improve customer shopping experience from good to excellent.",en,9 months ago,2024-11-12T18:50:23.875762Z,Andi May

Plenty of nearby local restaurants and convenience store. Staff are polite and attend promptly to guests' needs and requests. Left valuable stuff visibly for couple of days and everything was always in place. Upkeep of room is regular and neat. AC works well. Room with window is a plus, you can observe outside activities and save electricity during daytime. Generous provision of tissue paper.

Cons: Bedroom and especially bathroom are quite small, not advisable for medium to large built people. Hallway sounds are audible as well as other ambient sounds like waterflow on pipes from upstairs room or the pouring rain. Bed is generally okay, could sleep comfortably, but linens (and bath towels) have visible stains. No bidet.",en,a year ago,2023-12-02T05:20:48.811272Z,Amen Quizon

It was worth the money. Not only were they friendly and helpful when I was in doubt, the boss recommended what work was needed to be done for my car. There were many parts that needed to be changed that the previous workshops didn't tell me to.

After servicing, my car ride was smoother. My car didn't vibrate so much anymore and my steering wheel was so smooth like butter. It was as if my car is brand new.

The hotel is conveniently located, close to many dining options and offers easy access to transportation.

The price is quite high, but it’s reasonable compared to the general rates in Singapore.

The interior and kitchen facilities are good, with a fridge and all the necessary utensils provided. However, the water heater is a bit slow.

It would be much better if there was a washing machine, as the nearby self-service laundry options are poor and do not accept Visa card payments.

The bathroom had an unpleasant smell and lacked a bidet spray.

Room access requires using an app on your phone. While this seems high-tech, it’s actually inconvenient for two people since only one person can open the door if they have the phone, making it less flexible.

Despite these drawbacks, considering the price and the great location in Singapore, I still find it acceptable and may return next time.

This is my honest review. Thank you.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-26T09:24:14.356791534Z,Richard Hoàng Việt Phú

Spoke to her about my body aching areas and she was very well attentive to them. She knows how to provide deep press massages, and helped to relief off a lot of air pockets from my daily workout stints on my arms, ribs, thighs etc.  Her number of  experience years in this field tells it all.

To know my physical challenges, I always have to walk a lot daily during my outdoor work covering some distances of 3km to 5km and i additionally perform my weekly weekend runs abt 5km to 10kms.

I looked out for the reliefs and recovery after all the pain pressed from the massages and she did very well from applying any kind of overstressing pressure on my muscles and joints.

Plus i felt so much better in terms of gaining more energy and ease of more physical mobility after having a few hours rest at home after the session.

Im now more than ever looking forward to having more sessions with her in the future.

We came around 12-ish pm on a Tuesday and it turned out to be a really great experience. The promotion was a good deal, $ 15.50 per person (after GST and service charge) for two hours, plus an extra hour free on weekdays. It also included one free drink and there were plenty of drink options to choose from, which made it even more worth it.

The room was super clean and honestly, the whole place was very well-maintained. Everything felt fresh and comfortable, which added to the enjoyment of our karaoke session. One thing that really stood out was the service. Sharon, the staff member who attended to us, was amazing. She greeted us with a warm smile and was soft-spoken and very polite throughout. Her customer service was top-notch and really made our day feel extra special.

It’s little things like that, clean facilities, good promotions and excellent service that make a big difference.

I love their cocktails priced at $9 each for happy hour! Their beers also have an offer of Buy 2 Free 1, though it's a small selection. Fantastic!

They don't have jim beam highball and whiskey :( so I got a vodka and tonic water, and it was super potent for $10. So worth!

Looks good, tastes nothing like it's supposed to.

Came here on a Sunday noon ard 3, 4pm, not much crowd but no hungry crowd cept for us maybe... So we tried ordering the ribs. It sucks. But context:
To say first, the wait staff here is AWESOME.
From the Auntie in the earlier shift to later shift the servers they are all great.

Just to say, ribs looks great but taste really not so great. Grey meat, tough, need to chew like mad, could be the worst ribs I ever had, to be fair, it's cheap so not complaint about the price.
$20 half rack
$30 full rack with we had, half tabao home cause I rather try microwave the shit out of it to tenderise it or make it softer.

PS. Seems like the chef don't care okay, which I understand... He's on a paycheck, he doesn't know I'm here on a first visit.

But don't give us dying meat la... Wha Lao eh

(Btw the nice Auntie told us we need to wait then we told her we no rush, slowly, take their time... Cause we having beer. But first pint only drank 1/4 amount ribs come out liao. Wow

How?

From the moment I stepped near the entrance, I had a bad feeling. The place looked filthy and poorly maintained. As soon as I entered the lobby, I was hit with a strong, fishy, unpleasant smell that only got worse upstairs.

The first room they gave me was crawling with cockroaches and ants – literally everywhere. I immediately went to the receptionist and asked for a room change. Shockingly, the second room was even worse. The aircon was broken, the bathroom was disgusting, and the pest problem was just as bad, if not worse. It felt more like a horror movie set than a hotel room.

Honestly, it was a nightmare to stay even for an hour. I cannot believe a hotel like this is allowed to operate in Singapore, a city known for cleanliness. There's clearly zero pest control or hygiene standards here, and yet they have the audacity to charge SGD 90 per night? For what exactly? Roaches and sleepless nights?

This place needs an urgent inspection, pest control, and a serious lesson in basic hospitality. Do yourself a favor and stay far away.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-03T11:00:51.901090Z,Kairj G

We can’t finish and we kept the bottle there. The bottle expired in 1 month time. So yesterday 12/8/2023 we went down to club slim again to claim out left over bottle (Chivas 18) sadly the staff and managers there come back to us that our bottle had been redeem on the 8/8/2023 which we never went down on that day.

The managers was telling me that so sadly that your name and phone number of the bottle had been redeemed. Which I can also said that your staff use my name and phone number keyed into your system and told me that the bottle had been redeemed! At the end of the day they just came back to me that our system showed your name had redeemed and did not do any further service recovery!

The other sad things about it was yesterday we open beer tower and the promo is 2+1 they are conflict also. Total we had 2+1(3sets) plus 1 tower which mean we total have 10 tower but we counted that everytime we asked for the 2+1 when after served the 2 tower the other 1 tower the staff will told us that we had redeemed but we was not redeemed yet.

We all just feel that this club slim not honour serving us. The management need to have more proper system!",en,2 years ago,2023-08-13T12:00:33.542993Z,fang ying

Doctors are efficient. I conveyed my feedback to the anchor Dr Aamir. He promised to speak to the receptionists so hope situation will improve in the future.
Receptionists have poor understanding of workflow, gave wrong information and still talked down on patients and arrogant.
1. Enquired on COVID vaccine and RSV vaccine. COVID vaccine needs to register on MOH webpage but NOT the clinic webpage (as advised to scan QR code of clinic at the counter). Only acknowledged this mistake after I offered twice to show them my phone.Told me no RSV vaccine available when it’s shown on website with price. Clearly they don’t even know what vaccine services are provided at the clinic and are too lazy to even look up upon request.
2. Vaccine record was missed by the first doctor to upload to healthHUB. Could be easily corrected by checking with the doctor. However receptionists first dismissed my request and told me to check with MOH??! Only upon insisting did they register me to clarify with the doctor who admitted it was a missed upload and amended on the spot.
3. Maid health check up records. We told the receptionists that we need a copy and the receptionists said they’d call us back in about 1 week to collect result. No phone call or follow up.

Saw LiteMobile on TikTok FYP for a burn mark on my LCD screen. Went to their branch, got the repair with a ""3-month warranty."" I pointed out a scratch immediately, but they said it was just dirt! Now there's a bright white spot that wasn't there before! The manufacturer is just rabak!

Their customer service (via WhatsApp) is APPALLING. Instant replies from another's phone pretending to be a new customer, but ""bohlayan"" when I tried to claim my warranty. After ranting to ""Desmond"" on WhatsApp, he offered a refund AND a new LCD. I refused because their rabak customer service made me lose all trust. They suddenly claimed my phone had a bloated battery and could damage the screen, wanting to ""check"" it. Sketchy!

LiteMobile needs to prioritize warranty claims and acknowledge issues instead of dismissing them. First and last time customer here. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else!

Simply my Go To for anything car related especially VAG as that’s Royston’s specialty. However that doesn’t mean they can’t handle Non VAG cars. They have worked on my Honda, my BMW and on my other friends Toyota, Lexus and many more! They have solved problems even on a Rolls Royce Ghost that other supposed workshops thought they could. And why? This boils down to EFFORT, KNOWLEDGE and COMMITMENT that is deeply rooted into this power team. The commitment that is derived from the NEVER SAY DIE spirit of theirs is something I deeply respect 🫡

Those who know me know I don’t trust workshops easily but Squad is the 1 of ONLY 2 Workshops I patronise whom I can entrust my car to and simply go for a holiday even and know that the car is in trustable good hands.

honestly as a food and coffee snob, i wouldnt go out of my way to come here for a meal, much less for the coffee. BUT i wouldnt object to friends who suggest meeting up here.

menu is predictable and food’s just about average in standard. service was a little lacking despite it being rather empty and off-peak (4pm), had to wave to get the attention of the service staff.

However, this new menu they had, were more expensive, yet food was not impressive. Perhaps, we were pampered by the previous visits.

They had more savoury this time, but the good felt cheaper than before (despite the higher price). The sandwich bread was so tough and rubbery, it was unpleasant to eat.

Services were okay this time, however, I don't understand why they placed us with another pair of customers so closely together when there were only two groups of us. Throughout the high tea, we could hear each other so loudly, and can't even take decent photos without capturing them in. They have such a spacious layout, and we still squeezed with each other.

Half way through, there was this more senior lady sever, who KEPT coming to our table and check on our tea. We were even done or near the end of high tea. Pure rudeness.

My car had issues with my side mirror, so i sent it down to be fixed as per my dealership (Vincar) instructions.

First off, they never informed me that the car had to be collected the next day, was under the impression it could be collected in the same day. I stayed in the area and only when it was 5pm and I gave them a call, then they told me it could be collected the next day.

Secondly, collected the car, mirror was jerky. They assured me it was a new part issue, tried to put some oil but issue was not resolved.

Lastly and the worse part, I just discovered these incapable staff curbed my rim when my car was with them and painted it over black which was why I didn't realise when I collected the car. Only realised when I was washing my own car and realised they didn't sand the part down. I was never informed of this and trying to cover this up just shows how dishonest they are.

They said we needed to order a minimum of 4 nonalcoholic drinks. We ended up ordering 2 nonalcoholic drinks, 1 bottle of prosecco and 2 plates of food. They counted the $108 bottle of prosecco as 1 drink, so technically we only ordered 3 drinks. They insisted that we purchase the remaining 1 drink during checkout. Very uncool.

Edit: We're changing the rating from 1-star to 3-stars. Management contacted us within 24 hours and apologised, saying the staff did not understand. They offered us a voucher for the next visit and requested we take down this review. We are satisfied with the service recovery and agree that raising the rating would be fair.",en,a month ago,2025-07-07T13:56:22.175743926Z,Debbie C

The ushers at the entrance are very arrogant, talk to you as if they want to beat you up!

I bought a voucher on Grab and the terms and condition only stated that the voucher should be redeemed on either Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. I went on a Saturday night, and showed them that I was there to redeem my voucher. The staff at the entrance told me I couldn’t use it because they had a special guest that night and wanted to 'avoid losses.'

When I asked which terms and conditions could prevent me from entering because of the presence of special guests, they told me it's their decision now and they would inform Grab partnership team next time. It becomes my own problem and I should deal with Grab myself instead!

Interestingly, the staff then admitted that the voucher is a clickbait as they don't want the customer to redeem the voucher, even though the voucher has stated that it should be redeemed within the specified day and period.

Does this imply that Zouk being a big and trusted corporation are playing click bait to cheat the customers? This is not only unprofessional but also completely disregards the rights of your customers!

When I asked to record their statement to raise dispute against Grab, one of the staff touched my phone and raised her tone towards me. This is completely unacceptable. First, did you have permission to touch my personal property? Second, how can you not take responsibility for what you've said, yet still represent Zouk?

I asked for their manager's email and emailed them the day after. But even after 4 days, there's no reply at all. So GO AT YOUR OWN RISK!",en,9 months ago,2024-11-28T05:07:48.020835Z,Teo CY

We were walking into this outlet and she was assorting the frozen section . My friend tried to reach the pasta which is also in the frozen section.(He did not make any physical contact with her and he had no intention either.) Suddenly she started flipping out and threatened to call 999 for not saying “excuse”. She raised her tone at the customers who did nothing wrong but just to get some snacks. I’m not sure she only did this because we’re not Singaporeans? Anyways, take actions please.

Went a couple times and jess always there to provide excellent service. She is super friendly. Company should praise her for her excellent service. It made the customers returned.

They use the old paper tickets. I also recommend keeping the tickets neat and orderly or else it'll be very difficult to ""feed"" the tickets in.

This is the worst hotel I have ever experienced, especially for the price of around 80 SGD per night.

1. The room was in terrible condition. The bathroom was full of flying insects. If you don’t mind being attacked by bugs all night, then go ahead and book here.
2. The room was extremely old and poorly maintained. The door was broken with large gaps, and I could clearly hear people talking in the hallway.
3. The noise was unbearable. Even with the air conditioning turned off, there was a loud mechanical noise, like heavy machinery running over my head. I had to wear headphones to sleep, which was torture. Another guest at the front desk also complained about the noise, but the staff simply said, ""All rooms are noisy because they are cheap.""

I booked four nights but left after the second night. The hotel refused to refund the remaining nights and did not even apologize.

Ratings:

•	Location: 5/5 (Convenient Bugis location)

•	Ambiance: 4/5 (Modern and stylish)

•	Room: 3/5 (Smaller than expected; two single beds instead of the booked room type)

•	Bathroom: 3/5 (Smaller than expected)

•	Booking & Communication: 1/5 (Reservation inexplicably cancelled; lack of timely notification)

•	Check-in Process: 2/5 (Unexpected $50 deposit requirement)

•	Overall: 2.5/5

My recent daycation at The Snooze Hotel @Bugis was unfortunately marred by a booking mishap and an unexpected additional expense. Despite receiving a confirmation message from Dayuse, upon arrival, I discovered my reservation had been inexplicably cancelled. While the staff were able to rectify the situation by offering a room at the original price, the only available option was a room with two single beds which was a disappointment, as my original booking was different. This highlights a significant flaw in their booking system, if a reservation is cancelled, guests should receive timely notification, not a last minute surprise upon arrival. The lack of communication was incredibly frustrating.

Adding to my disappointment , I was also required to pay a $50 cash deposit upon check in, a requirement that was not mentioned during the booking process. This unexpected additional cost further detracted from the overall experience.

The room itself, while reflecting the compact design shown in photos, was still smaller than I expected, as was the bathroom. Despite the initial hiccup, the hotel's modern aesthetic and convenient Bugis location are definite plus points. However, improvements to their booking process, communication, and transparency regarding additional costs are crucial to avoid similar issues for future guests. The overall experience was negatively impacted by the poor communication surrounding the cancellation and the unexpected deposit.",en,a month ago,2025-07-20T14:07:35.214497368Z,oXRYSTALo Ong

I came in as a walk-in at 730am today right before the opening time at 8am because I was vomiting badly and feeling extremely lightheaded in the morning. I’ve also been visiting this clinic for an eye infection, so it made sense to come back here.

At the registration counter, I told the Chinese lady that I was feeling very unwell and couldn’t go to a GP because I was lightheaded and could throw up anytime. I also explained that I’m on ComCare and can’t afford to go to a private clinic. Still, she said they will only see case that is urgent and that the doctor’s schedule was fully booked, and just told me to buy medicine from the pharmacy.

But I’d already taken medicine, and I needed a doctor to assess what was actually wrong. I felt helpless.

I’m really grateful to the Indian lady near the self-check-in kiosk who saw how pale I looked and told me to keep checking the app for any available slots. She was the only one who showed concern when I could barely see clearly anymore.

It’s frustrating and disheartening to be turned away when you’re visibly unwell. The least u could do is make an effort and go an extra mile.I hope they can better assess such situations, especially for those of us facing financial difficulties.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-31T01:02:32.732157Z,Putri P

We also had the truffle fries. It was very crispy and addictive! We kept reaching out for more and wished the portion was bigger 🤤 The last dish was muah Chee. I like that it’s not too sweet, and the texture was slightly softer, maybe because it was served hot. If you like to drink and are looking for a chill and cozy place to vibe with your friends, LUSS is the place to go. They have an extensive range of alcoholic drinks; you will definitely be spoiled for choices. The staff were friendly, attentive, and approachable.

I went there at 11:30am, the only receptionist was on the phone. She could have just nodded to me but she ignored my existence until she finished her call, which was some 10 minutes later.

The wait to see the doctor was fast as there were only a few patients. The consultation was longer than normal, but the consultation fee was $130, which I think is super expensive for a GP! And doctor didn’t even administer vaccination himself. The shots were administered by someone else in the procedure room.

The procedure room nurses could be A LOT nicer considering there were so few patients in the clinic that morning. The nurses were cold and business like. No self introduction (I hope they were registered nurses), no explanation of the procedure or check of the identity, just stick out your arm and let me poke kind of attitude.

The cashier was the nicest of all the people I met, though the bill was horrible - over $500!

I honestly feel the service should be improved  not just they were charging much more than even specialist clinic, but the patients deserve a bit of love tender care.",en,a year ago,2024-03-01T01:31:19.053591Z,E E

However, it seems to be less a hostel and more a permanent housing place for men who rent beds for months at a time. When we got there, they’d overbooked the double beds in the smaller rooms, and we each had to take a single bunk in a room of men who were quite clearly living there. I felt uneasy, unsafe and wasn’t sure what to make of this. Then there’s the bathrooms. They are filthy. Urine all over the floor (and no where near the toilet bowl either). I had to throw some socks away because it was so gross.

Pros
1. The staff name M is so good at customer service.
2. Near to proper city.

Cons
1.  There is so many roaches in the room (3rd floor room 3-3) i already reported to them but nothing happen to solve the issue.
2. There is a bed bug on my bed. I didn't sleep well for almost 2 weeks.   Just wake up one evening and my back hurt so much.    I caught the bed bugs and take apicture of it.
3. The room smells bad. After leaving the place and transfer to a house already.  The smell is still on my clothes.

The combination of the savory minced meat and earthy mushrooms is perfectly balanced, creating a rich and hearty flavor profile that keeps you coming back for more. The noodles were cooked to perfection – springy and soaked up all that delicious sauce.

What really stood out was the seasoning – not too overpowering, but just enough to bring out the depth of the ingredients. Each bite was packed with flavor! It’s also served fresh and in generous portions, making it great value for the price.

This dish is a must-try for noodle lovers! Whether you're ordering it for a quick lunch or a dinner treat, it’s bound to satisfy. Highly recommend it – you won’t regret it! 🍜👌

Initially, I thought the problem was with my Wi-Fi, so I purchased a LAN cable and a TP-Link UH6120C USB Type-C 6-Port Hub from the store. However, even after testing these at home, my laptop still couldn’t establish a stable connection.

Upon returning to Best Denki for assistance, I was fortunate to be helped again by Felixx Teo, the same Sales Specialist who had assisted me with my purchase. Felixx went above and beyond—instead of simply processing a return or exchange, he took the time to thoroughly investigate the issue. He tested both the cable and the adapter, patiently troubleshooting to identify the root cause.

To my surprise, the problem wasn’t with the products I had bought—it was actually a faulty Wi-Fi adapter in my laptop. What truly impressed me was that Felix didn’t stop there—he fixed the issue on the spot, ensuring my laptop could connect properly. His technical expertise, dedication, and willingness to help—even beyond his role as a sales advisor—were exceptional.

Felix’s service was a perfect example of customer care at its best. He didn’t just sell a product; he provided a complete solution with professionalism and a positive attitude. I’m extremely grateful for his assistance and highly recommend him to anyone shopping at Best Denki.

Thank you, Felix, for your outstanding support—you’ve earned a loyal customer!",en,2 months ago,2025-06-06T08:56:45.488074Z,Christine Francisco

The dorm beds are comfortable. The staff is kind of indifferent to guests, I felt like we were bothering them with requests or questions in general. The location is good, Bus stop and metro only a couple of minutes away. The hostel is very small and narrow, there is a desk and chairs along the wall of the hallway but no room to hang out other than sitting right in front of the reception desk by the entrance. We only came here to sleep and stayed away for most of the day so it was OK. There's a karaoke bar next door that you will hear through the walls until early in the morning. Might not bother you if you are a heavy sleeper though.

Several times during the session nearly dozed off even though the massage pressure was firm. At the end, even offered a hot drink.

Overall ambience was good. Old wooden buildings have more charm but wooden furniture will creak with food steps on the wooden floor as well as opening/closing doors. Maybe I was the only one but it was quiet and calm I.e. relaxing.

Room did not have a shower but at the floor level there was a shower room and toilet.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-14T13:31:42.833348Z,Paul Yee

Called around 11pm to check availability and was told by the counter staff, Jojo, that there was a slot in 15 minutes. I took a cab over, but just few minutes before arriving, she informed me that she had overlooked earlier bookings and that I would now have to wait an hour.

It was close to midnight, and with nowhere else to go, I asked if the cab fare could be reimbursed given the sudden change. Instead, I was met with excuses — that she was new, crossed in and out of JB, had to pay rent, etc. She even went on to say Singaporeans are “calculative,” I told her it's not a matter of being a Singaporean but about professionalism, she insisted that she's right and that she never faced this when working in JB.

She later said that her boss wants to offer discount the next time I visit but with this kind of attitude and still expect me to return there again? No thank you.",en,a month ago,2025-07-16T07:34:06.521891281Z,YZ T

This hidden gem, while seemingly simple, is a breathtaking reminder of nature’s beauty and resilience, standing tall against the backdrop of suburban life.

As you approach, the ambiance shifts. The gentle rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of birds create a serene soundtrack that invites you to pause and breathe deeply. The tree, with its sprawling branches and lush green canopy, forms a natural cathedral, beckoning visitors to experience its tranquility. I vividly remember my first visit on a sunny afternoon; the light filtered through the leaves, casting intricate patterns on the ground, making it feel almost magical.

What truly sets the Great Shelford Tree apart is its history. Local lore suggests that this tree has stood for over a century, witnessing the ebb and flow of life around it. Generations of families have gathered beneath its branches for picnics, storytelling, and even proposals. I spoke to a local elder who fondly recounted how, as a child, he would climb its sturdy limbs, feeling like a king surveying his kingdom. It’s clear this tree has served as a silent witness to countless life events, each one adding to its mystique.

Visitors often come not just for the beauty, but for the personal connections they forge with this magnificent tree. I’ve seen people leave behind tokens—a painted rock, a love note, or a small memento—each representing a moment of joy or a wish for the future. On my second visit, I joined a group of artists for a plein air painting session. The atmosphere was electric, filled with laughter and creativity as we each attempted to capture the tree’s essence. As I painted, I felt a connection to those who had come before me, each brushstroke a tribute to the tree’s enduring legacy.

The Great Shelford Tree also serves as a hub for the community. Throughout the year, various events take place around this majestic tree—seasonal festivals, quaint gatherings, and meditation sessions. The camaraderie is palpable as friends connect over their love for this natural wonder.

One of the most poignant aspects of the Great Shelford Tree is its capacity for reflection. Standing beneath its vast canopy, I often contemplate my life journey. In a world that feels overwhelming, this tree offers grounding and peace. It has become a personal sanctuary where I can escape the hustle and bustle of daily life.

For those seeking inspiration, solace, or a simple moment of connection with nature, the Great Shelford Tree is an essential stop. It’s not just a tourist attraction; it’s a life-changing experience that encourages you to slow down, appreciate the beauty around you, and forge connections—with both nature and those around you.

If you find yourself in the vicinity, I urge you to pay a visit. Bring a journal, a sketchbook, or simply your thoughts. You may leave with a renewed sense of purpose or just a smile, knowing you’ve encountered something truly special. The Great Shelford Tree isn’t just a tree; it’s a monument to life itself, waiting to share its wisdom with anyone willing to listen.",en,10 months ago,2024-10-17T13:30:26.271915Z,Shawn

A couple stalls that we used to frequent has been replaced and I feel not for the better. The Japanese curry stall which was pretty good is gone as is the tenderfresh express.

Fortunately a couple of our usual favourites, the [YongTauFoo] stall and the [MiniWok] stall are still there and [DanLao].

Tried the new stall, [Pondok Nasi Lemak] and it was meh. While the ayam berempah was eatable, it's a shadow of how great a ayam berempah could actually be. The rendang was unfortunate. I ate half and gave up. It was not terrible, but it was not good either.

There’s a new halal Nasi Lemak stall that is tempting me everyday and I made a mental note to try the baked nasi lemak on my diet cheat day! 😅

I also love that I can have my fave Koka Noodle any time now. Besides noodles, the same Koka stall sells incredibly tasty and hearty Cantonese chok (porridge). Now, I’m just waiting for my friends outside UTown to come and meet me for lunch. Lai lai lai! 😆

I saw the Avengers machines both with lights on and no tape, so I decided to play and draw 50 tokens out.

However, the machine rejected all my tokens, and when I asked the staff for assistance, he said the machine was spoilt and BOTH machines couldn't be played. But there was no indications or signs that said the machine was unable to play. He just smiles and nods in agreement?!?! Is it so hard to put the black tap on?

I then went to the counter to request a refund, since there wasn't any other machine I would like to play. And the counter staff said no refunds for token.

But in the first place, I wouldn't have redrawn the token if the machine showed that it was unavailable. There was no tape, and the lights and wheels were spinning.

Why did your staff's negligence in doing their job cause me to need to bring home 50 tokens? Super upset hearing upon this, and your staff weren't exactly friendly either. Should i be thankful i only drawn 50 tokens out.

Super bad experience in this outlet, and its not the first time! please do something about it. It is not fair for your customers too.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-20T12:14:37.779747Z,Tan Qm

Century Square 19 June 2025-2130-2245hrs = Coin changing machine not working, cash exchange machine waited 30 mins upon frequent request to fix ignored. After playing one of the toy push displacement machine for an hour, managed to win the red stopper prize. I alerted this Indian maintenance staff (photo-without glasses, light facial stubble, stout built, 5'6"") several times at close range but he deliberately ignored me until I walked right up to him to respond. He snapped back in a hostile manner and replied "" WHAT ?!!"" I calmly told him I won the prize to collect and was shocked he angrily retorted, "" So, shake for it!"". I then firmly repeated to collect my prize. He then went to reset the machine and pass me the prize from the counter. I then calmly requested for his name for reference but again he ignored me. I insisted he provide his name and added that if he felt his hostile attitude was justified, why would he be reluctant to own up to his uncouth behavior. He then challenged me to go report on Facebook when I requested for his name again. He snapped back and instructed I just identify him as ""the Indian guy"". I informed him that there were more than few Indian staff there so his name was required. He then ignored me again. I then calmly snapped a facial photo of him for reference and he turned hostile questioning me several times why I took his photo. I simply smiled and replied, "" So?.. It's for your management."" I firmly stood my ground and paused for his possible retaliation. I definitely wouldn't have had hesitated to call the police had he dared made further threatening movements towards me.
Anyways, my 2 cents.. If any of your staff is unhappy working there, please tell them, like what locals say,  to stay home, shake legs, and don't work to avoid antagonizing good paying customers without cause. As for myself, I'm pretty done tolerating all your bad staff behavior and probably no longer patronize your franchise once I clear my balance tokens, since, from so many bad reviews, nothing seems to be rectified. Last year before closing hours, my bad, I left my pouch with cash filled, Credit cards, ID,.. Etc. wallet overnight at your machine and even calling the 1st  morning maintenance staff on opening hours to check. He kept informing nothing found and kept brushing off my concerns claiming very busy. Nevertheless, I personally rushed down to your CS branch to confirm with that Chinese morning staff and I even offered $100 reward to view the cctv. He refused but I demanded to view the cctv to trace the point of my own negligence or I'll call the police. He relented. Once it was clear the cctv showed the night staff found it, that morning staff miraculously revealed that my bag suddenly appeared and was found and placed under the cash register. It was not there before. I still kept my integrity and gave him the$100 reward to share with the honest Malay night staff , despite knowing I could have easily called the police on his intentions to keep my bag after viewing the cctv. So much for your staff professionalism. Do better.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-20T16:31:33.409930746Z,Kenzo Hideyo Saito

Smallish restaurant, nestled amongst a long stretch of eateries.

Ordered a chicken briyani, daily non-veg set, extra serving of masala chicken, garlic naan and some drinks.

The daily set is good value-for-money. Tandoori chix on the plate is tasty.

Briyani rice is flavourful but only 2pcs of chicken (hence the extra serving of masala chix).

Masala chix is nice and spicy. But not really worth paying S$10.50.

Lassi was ok, but also rather pricey at S$6.

Masala tea is nice.",en,11 months ago,2024-09-11T06:08:12.269555Z,Jimmy Liaw

I personally feel this service by “TY” is top notch.
He is very and I mean very patience with me when I asked him questions about phones regarding specs etc . You can try going to SingTel / M1 shop you won’t get this kind of service .
He will carefully access your budget / your daily use of phone and how you’re going to use it, based on that then he will recommend which phone is suitable for you. But at the end of the day he will tell me . Ultimately is need to see whether I can accept the branding of the phone, no pressure / hard selling from this guy , felt very comfortable during the whole interaction .

Give this guy a thumbs up👍 will come back again to this man if I were to buy a new phone again .",en,a week ago,2025-08-19T01:50:53.127720682Z,Prime Reawaken

Book via Agoda with app discounts and cost abt 9 SGD per night

Compared to other bad reviews here's what I found:

Pros
- Legit hotel. not a scam like other OYOs lol
- Bathroom was clean and no smell. But no amenities whatsoever except for one tiny hand soap
- WiFi was okay. Can doomscroll at night. Occasional disconnects
- shower have hot/cold water
- nearby have shops and convi stores to have dinner till night
- Pretty near from Nagoya mall. 10 mins walk
- TV works. Indo, Chinese, Korean, English channels
- Bath towel (2 big ones given) have steamed wash smell. I've seen worse for budget
- Staff are friendly and helpful.
- Hot water available but at the ground floor water cooler (better than none I guess?)

Cons
- A little bit room smell when opening door. Later it's gone
- Bed sheets not clean. Some yellow stains visible under the blanket. Cig holes on bed sheet too
- Pillows smells a bit of oil and sweat. Not thoroughly washed
- Worn down furniture & items.
- Except for 2 water bottles and a single soap. No other amenities
- One tiny 🪳 in cabinet & another 🪳 near bedside to accompany me. How thoughtful
- at times reeks smoking smell from other rooms if you're not a smoker
- can hear foot steps and kids running in corridor. Not sound proof for ykiyk

Overall
Budget solo traveller just finding a place to stay one, two nights? Pretty fine.

For couples, families, or just ladies? Better pay more and find another hotel",en,a month ago,2025-07-07T06:56:09.843516195Z,Leon

If you want to experience the worst hotel in Batam Island, please come here. Don't be fooled by their ratings. I don't deny that this is a cheap hotel, but it doesn't mean you can treat your customers like this. First of all, this is a very bad location. It is located inside the wholesale market and the road conditions are very bad. After check in at front desk, you will see the very hellish room quality. The toilet floor is disgusting. The bed sheet is yellow. Yes, it is yellow. Very disgusting 🤮🤮, the air conditioner is hot air. The chairs and tables are very dirty. There are blood clots on the floor. The whole room is filled with very, very bad smells and very strong smoke. Very, very bad experience.

The matcha is low quality and tastes exactly like cheap store-bought powder mixed with milk powder. The colour is an ugly yellow green which already screams poor quality and bad storage. My cup was 98% milk with barely any matcha taste.

Also they keep the matcha powder in a transparent container which is a big no no because light exposure oxidises matcha and ruins the taste and colour.

And they did not even sift it😭 They just stirred it straight into a metal jug with a spoon. This makes me think it is not even 100 percent matcha powder cus is that how u handle good quality matcha.

$6 gone for something this horrible😔 You can get way better strawberry matcha outside for cheaper 🥀

🟨 I visited CS Fresh @ Cluny Court on Wed, May 14th, 2025, and had a great shopping experience.

🟩 This large Cold Storage supermarket is well-stocked with a wide range of products, catering to the diverse needs of the expat community in the area. 🔵 The decor and layout are modern and clean, making it easy to navigate the aisles.

⬛️ The service standards were great, thanks to the friendly and kind cashier, Jumana. She was efficient and pleasant, making the checkout process very smooth.

🩷 Thank You Jumana for your kind hospitality earlier ( hope I spelt her name correctly)

🟦 I used my CDC vouchers to purchase some gourmet Japanese ( ✅️ Bourbon brand Torte biscuits ) as birthday gifts.🟨 I also bought other Western cookies, grapes, mushroom soups and sushi rolls from the deli.

🟢 The supermarket's location in Cluny Court, a hub for expats and affluent residents, seems to cater well to their needs.

🟠 Location =🔶️  Take the Circle Line to Botanical Gardens MRT station.

✅️ 🟡 Use Exit A. ➡️ Cross the small road ( Cluny Road) and Cluny Court is just there.

Problem 1: They have no idea where to locate the products, directing your questions to their colleagues (to which you will be redirected to another colleague). I refuse to be treated like a caller making a phone call to a help centre.

When it was finally my turn, the cashier directed me to the self check out counter, and told me that she would assist me there. She then passed me two plastic bags and told me to scan the entire basket of products by myself.

This is appalling - if I intended to use the self check out counter, why would I bother to spend 10 minutes of my time to queue up at the counter? As a paying customer, why am I being instructed by an employee to do her job for her?

Kueh Tutu is also sold here, and this is one of the local delicacies that is getting hard to find. Overall, this is a pretty well-rounded food centre.

For an extra treat, ask for your carrot cake to be more charred. The added smokiness enhances the overall flavor, making each bite even more irresistible. And don’t forget to request to top it off with a fried egg – the creamy yolk adds a rich, savory touch that complements the dish beautifully.

The doctor took over an hour for a simple consultation, and the nurse made me wait another 30 minutes just to get my medicine, saying she was “searching” for it.

I initially visited to collect my high blood pressure medication and cough medicine. Instead, the doctor forced me to take a $10 COVID test even though I had been testing negative at home for a week. He didn’t even check my result—just took the money. Then, he refused to give me a two-month supply of my regular medication unless I did unnecessary blood and urine tests, even though my company had already scheduled a full medical check-up in just 12 days.

To make things worse, I only had a cough, yet he prescribed medicine for a blocked nose, runny nose, and allergies—none of which I had. After all this, he only gave me a 10-day supply of my blood pressure medicine.

Dr kevin when i  tell him i feel dizzy drowzy he ask is it low or high drowzy  and then i feel abit high temp in me he ask do i have a fever i am like how i know if i got fever dont he have a thermometer with him to check.  he also randomly give an ART KIT when i say i got cough when i already know i  dont have covid.

during the consultation the auntie presuming the cleaner keep sweeping and moping the floor which is unprofessional for a consulatation shouldnt she be doing all that before the opening hours?

I not sure what happen when Dr kevin went to the washroom or something like that the auntie shouted in hokkien to him  Wa eh chiu which means MY HAND and smth along the line and she say (you do since you want this way i can leave) to him .  which gives 3 person beside me a bad impression of the clinic .

This food is quite amazing, it is essentially a slice fish soup stall with lots of pork minced meat variations.
The cook is very attentive and fast and generous with his serving of garnishes.
I ordered the Mee Pok with only the fish ball and fried fish sticks. My partner ordered the teo chew fish porridge soup. Both are very tasty and full of aroma. I think (not sure) they put garlic bits into their soup, or salted fish, or both?
The mee pok is tangy and the noodles is springy enough but not ""al dente"" like some of the best I've tasted before. The fish porridege has luscious serving of fish slices and tomato and vegetables. The mee pok and the soup that comes with it, gets a 5 star from me. The rest, well they can improve.
The fish balls were fishy enough and has an acceptable tautness to it, but it far lacks the stall in Newton Circus, which I've reviewed. That's one of the best, perhaps in singapore.
i would not hesitate going there to eat the next time I pass by that place. You should defintely give it a try, they have a good range. And most of all, the soups are full of flavour!",en,a year ago,2023-12-06T02:27:27.367497Z,Wie b l

There were some customers ahead and so waited for about 15 mins before the staff served me. They got my details and retrieved the phone which was set aside for me. The whole process was over in 10 mins. Fast and prompt. Staff were polite and assisted me in my queries. First time buying from Mister Mobile and to be frank I was impressed with their service. I think it is even better than some of the mainline mobile store. Their phones are much cheaper too compared to other outlets. Will definitely remember them when I get my next phone.

Have been here thrice and love the retro karaoke pub vibes and the bar grubs! Especially recommend the sotong balls & vegetarian rolls 😋😋 Couldn’t get enough of them ☺️☺️

I like the easy to navigate song search system. Scan the QR code at your table and you have a long list of English, Chinese & Canto songs to choose from.

Heard from the staff they have open mic Live Singing sessions on Thurs & Sat Nights. Would love to check them out in the future.

Totally different
The bald guy is also very rude, doesn’t know how to talk to guest as well as smokes cigarettes in-front of the hotel and lift is not working and needs to climb stairs always
And level 2 is occupied by migrant workers and its their dormitory

Very satisfied with the repair and service.

The screen was shattered and the phone could not be turned on. The serviceman was able to give a good and proper diagnosis of the issues immediately. Diagnosis was better than what the authorised Google service centre gave which suggested that it was a motherboard issue and to replace the screen and motherboard which turned out to be incorrect. The serviceman just suggested a screen replacement only which is a lot better because my data would not be affected. He was also able to give satisfactory answers to all of my queries.

Pleasantly surprised that the shop actually has the replacement for such an older phone model. Repair was really quick and the phone was ready for collection the next day. My data was preserved and the phone is working as good as new!

Price of the repair was around half of what the Google service centre quoted.",en,10 months ago,2024-10-04T18:20:23.498062Z,Christopher Lin

🟫 The construction of the Jubilee bridge was actually suggested by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.

⚫️ Reason = In 2004, while visiting Marina Bay, Mr Lee Kuan Yew realised that pedestrians had to walk to Esplanade Bridge to cross the Singapore River, which he felt was too narrow.

✔️ Because of this, Jubilee Bridge was constructed & designed to run alongside Esplanade Bridge, but at a lower and more pedestrian-friendly level.

A special shoutout to my physiotherapist, Jerald Ang, who was outstanding throughout the entire process. He was thorough, knowledgeable, and incredibly professional. Before starting any treatment, he took the time to diagnose my injury very specifically, conducting a comprehensive series of assessments to ensure he fully understood the nature of the problem.

Jerald made me feel completely at ease during every session. He explained everything clearly, answered all my questions patiently, and tailored the treatment plan thoughtfully. He also took the initiative to book follow-up appointments after each of my first three sessions to ensure continuity of care.

Booking was seamless and efficient—I was able to secure an appointment quickly with a referral letter from my GP.
My treatment involved a combination of ultrasound therapy and guided rehabilitation exercises, and after just four sessions, I was successfully discharged with a clear plan to continue strengthening on my own. I'm now pain-free and back to my usual activities.

I highly recommend Heartland Rehab—especially Jerald—for anyone seeking physiotherapy with a personalised, evidence-based, and compassionate approach. Thank you for getting me back on track!",en,4 months ago,2025-04-30T01:37:00.953813Z,Dharmi Morjaria

A great option for focus and grinding.

Credits price (at time of writing):
$10 = 115 credits
$20 = 260 credits
$50 = 750 credits

Min top up $2 (20 credits)
Card price $1

Maimai price: 8 credits per game
With the $50 promotion, each game is $0.53.
At base price each game is $0.8, a rate that beats even the bulk price of Cow Play Cow Moo Suntec.

Review:
First off, the arcade is relatively quiet and spacious. It appears to have a focus on actual games- maimai and Wangan- rather than the chance games that most arcades have too many of. Because of this, there is a distinct lack of bright lights and irritating background sounds to distract from play. The rhythm game area is lit but not too brightly, while the Wangan area is darker which (in my opinion) is great for focus.

The staff here are really chill, and very helpful. They are generally polite and easy to make payment or request service with.

Even saying all this, I have not mentioned the two main advantages of this arcade: That maimai plays are incredibly cheap (at $0.67 per game), and that the equipment is in incredible condition.

The maimai machines here are very, very new. The buttons feel completely mint (despite I believe  two of the cabs being the previous gen) and I have yet to have any reason to question the hitreg... unlike with some arcades.

Also, this arcade has 4 maimai cabs (with 2 machines each). 2 cabs are the latest gen, while 2 are the previous gen. Because the sets of 2 cabs are far from each other, people only queue for 2 cabs on one side of the arcade, with groups often sticking to one side. This may alleviate queues for smaller groups.

It is a similar story with the Wangan machines. When I last played a few months back the shifters were very clean and tight, and the wheels felt new. This will probably not change soon as despite the number of machines, there are not a lot of Wangan players here. Another advantage for maimai players, arguably.

Lastly, the arcade is in a good location. It is the first shop you see coming down the escalator to the basement, and it is near to a toilet, Sheng Shiong, and Qiji nasi lemak.

As for downsides, the most obvious is the inconvenient location. Kinex is in a rather obscure place, and is a bit irritating to reach by public transport. The mall itself is (in my opinion) uninteresting, though at least the Daiso sells work gloves (but no winter glove) that can be used for maimai.

In addition, the arcade is of course not flawless. During my last session there was an issue with the Funtan card readers, which made all but one card (mine) unable to insert credits. However, since this issue was tackled immediately by the staff, and  also led to a rather fun incident where every single player in the arcade rotated to play a single song on one cabinet, I can forgive it. As for the card system, it is both convenient but also a bit cumbersome (credits take a couple seconds to register and the buttons are hard to understand), but I prefer it overall as it saves the hassle of a huge bag of tokens.

All in all, I don't regret buy 750 credits for 75 plays and I will be coming back. If I can just....find a more convenient bus and the time to travel down.

Oh, and the mall's bicycle rack sucks so. Have fun with that. Hope you like locking only one wheel. I just use the railings.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-21T05:25:23.533264600Z,Maplestruck

A heritage brand with roots dating back to the 1960s, Kou Kee serves up traditional Hakka-style Yong Tau Foo — each piece carefully hand-stuffed with fresh fish paste. We paired our selection with chee cheong fun and their signature sauce — rich, savory, and just the right amount of sweet. Comfort food at its best. 😋

Spotted other familiar names too — Boon Tong Kee, Ah Mei Chicken Rice, Li Xin Fishball Noodles, and even new dessert counters waiting to be explored. We’ll be back!

Needless to say, my doubts were unfounded, the chicken was crispy yet having just enough moisture, while the sambal was so pedas yet so sedap. And because they ran out of soup they gave me an extra piece of tahu goreng.

Lesson learned - don’t be too quick to judge a stall by preconceptions. Let’s be more open-minded and enjoy delicious food!

Note: Food Republic charges exorbitant amount of rent onto these stall owners (some of them are chains some not) and they have no choice but to pass on the costs to us.

A sunny day well spent exploring a truly unique and artistic park. This Asian cultural park, originally known as Tiger Balm Garden, was created by the Aw family — the founders of the Tiger Balm brand. It's fascinating to read the stories & beliefs behind each statue and scene they've built.

It's a place where both adults & kids can enjoy a blend of culture, art, and history. You could easily spend around two hours wandering through the thoughtfully designed displays and soaking in the atmosphere.

Entry is free, which makes it even more worth a visit. However, the only downside is that the park isn’t as well-maintained as it deserves to be. Not much shelter.

Pro tips:
🦟 Bring mosquito repellent
🐜 Watch out for red ants in some corners
Can bring some handheld fans

Despite those minor issues, it’s a memorable and educational experience — one that leaves a lasting impression.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-09T12:25:14.653195Z,Yiling Lai

I recently visited 11 SPA and had a rather mixed experience. Let’s start with the positives—the place is impeccably clean, which is always a major plus. The massage itself was technically very good, with the right level of strength and pressure applied throughout. If you're looking purely for a solid massage, this spa does deliver in that aspect.

However, there were a few things that left me feeling indifferent. First, the therapists don't quite resemble their photos, making it difficult to judge their actual age due to heavy makeup. More importantly, while the massage was effective, it was entirely mechanical—devoid of any warmth or connection. Unlike other high-quality spas where therapists bring a sense of professional intimacy and care into the experience, here it felt like an assembly-line process.

What made the experience even stranger was the sudden switch at the end, where the masseuse hinted at ""special services."" Given the entirely robotic interaction up to that point, it felt completely out of place. Honestly, by then, any mood for such a thing was long gone unless someone is desperate enough to go through with it just for the sake of it.

One last note—this spa accepts credit card, NETS, cash payments, which is very convenient.

**Final Verdict:** If you want a clean place and a technically proficient massage, 11 SPA is decent. But if you’re looking for an experience with warmth, care, and a human touch, this is probably not the place for you.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-13T13:01:43.988476Z,Urban Explorer

Whether you're stopping in for a casual meal, a round of drinks with friends, or some weekend entertainment, Cowboy Bar & Grill delivers a consistently fun and satisfying experience.

From the moment you walk in, the Western-themed decor sets the tone—wood-paneled walls, cowboy hats, vintage signs, and country-style furniture create an authentic, down-to-earth vibe. It’s the kind of place that feels relaxed and comfortable, whether you're in boots and jeans or just dropping by after work.

The menu is everything you’d expect from a hearty grill spot—and more. It offers a wide selection of grilled meats, burgers, ribs, steaks, and Tex-Mex favorites. The BBQ ribs are a must-try—slow-cooked to perfection, tender, and slathered in a smoky-sweet sauce. The burgers are juicy and flavorful, stacked high with quality ingredients. Sides like loaded fries, coleslaw, and cornbread round out the meals with satisfying portions. There are even vegetarian-friendly options that don’t compromise on flavor.

The bar is equally impressive, featuring a strong lineup of beers, whiskeys, and signature cocktails. The bartenders are friendly and fast, always ready with a recommendation or to craft your favorite drink. Happy hour specials make it easy to enjoy top-shelf drinks without breaking the bank.

Live music and events are another major draw. From country and rock bands to open mic nights and line dancing sessions, the entertainment adds to the energetic, community-driven feel of the place. It’s not just a restaurant—it’s a destination for a good time.

Service at Cowboy Bar & Grill is always prompt and friendly. The staff is attentive without being overbearing, and they contribute greatly to the warm and relaxed environment. You can tell they enjoy working there, and it reflects in their positive attitude toward customers.

In conclusion, Cowboy Bar & Grill is the perfect spot for those who enjoy hearty food, strong drinks, and good company in a lively, Western-style setting. Whether you're a local or just passing through, it’s a place that invites you to kick back, relax, and stay awhile.",en,a month ago,2025-07-26T08:23:16.259379091Z,Chloe Lim

Really didn't expect their western will be that good if compare to other normal western stall in singapore I definitely put their stall in my ""can go back list"" . But is a good and bad catch due to the location they open at. But really felt grateful and happy finally have a western stall open in foodini after so long and bonus the western quality is superior..

The phone was literally curved and the laptop was pretty smashed up. I googled and found that Fixbot had the highest number of reviews with a fantastic rating. I was initially concerned that these weren't genuine ratings, but reading through some of them convinced me otherwise.

I brought my phone down to test their service and they worked a miracle within 24 hours. They literally dissembled the entire phone to carefully straighten out every kink and curve. Then they reassembled the phone and it worked perfectly. The charges were more than reasonable, and it even came with a monthlong warranty!

The service was also very prompt and polite, with regular WhatsApp updates and very responsive replies.

I brought my laptop over and they examined it within the afternoon as promised before carefully explaining everything we'd need to do to get it sorted.

It was very reassuring, and the charges were transparent without any excess as well (this was also what I'd experienced with my phone repair, which I was very thankful for).

These guys are magicians. No doubt about it! Highly recommended! There's no other repair shop for me from hereon out, thanks Fixbot!",en,4 months ago,2025-04-08T13:04:33.563748Z,Ruth LX

Recently, I brought my daughter here and was attended to by a male doctor we hadn’t seen before. He was professional and caring, which gave me more confidence in the clinic.

Today, I visited for myself and decided it was time to write a review. Dr. Ho attended to me for an upset tummy. He was very detailed in his assessment, and when he heard my chesty cough, he took the initiative to ask how long it had been and checked my lungs to be safe. He then prescribed medication for both my tummy cramps and cough.

Overall, I really appreciated his thoroughness and care.

This is hands down one of the most frustrating and painful service experiences I’ve had. I brought in a Samsung device for what should have been a straightforward power button repair. I was first quoted around $200, then later received a text saying that the cost had increased to over $400—with no proper explanation.

When I finally received a call, I was told the technician had now found the touchscreen to be “faulty.” How convenient—this issue only appeared after they disassembled the device. I was then told they couldn’t perform a partial repair just for the power button, so I’d have to pay for the screen as well.

Over the phone, I specifically asked multiple times if my device would be returned in the same condition if I didn’t proceed and the person acknowledged that it would, and I made my expectations very clear. Even before sending it in, I made this expectation known—but now, of course, no one will admit to it.

When I didn’t proceed with the repair and came to collect my device, I checked and had to ask them to charge and demonstrate it—and that’s when it was revealed the screen wasn’t even showing the charging indicator anymore.

Here’s the worst part—when they tried to justify it, they told me that fixing the button would “unavoidably” damage the touchscreen, meaning I’d be forced to pay for both. If that was the case, WHY wasn’t it disclosed upfront? Why quote one thing, then hold my device hostage with unexpected, unexplained charges?

Zero transparency. No accountability. The responses felt scripted, and the way things were handled left me, the customer, feeling like I was somehow at fault for not asking the “right” questions—when I had, multiple times. Save yourself the trouble. Don’t send your device here unless you’re ready to be overcharged, misled, and left angry and helpless.",en,3 weeks ago,2025-08-02T13:36:06.643760821Z,Hakushaku 07

Perhaps you think this is just a pleasant add-on service to check for your device health - but it's *mandatory*. You can't refuse. No matter how you protest, the staff insist that they scan your device because they replaced your screen protector. We have absolutely no idea what they're doing with your personal data.

I declined and asked if they can open the phone case to do a detailed check. The personnel assure me that it would not help and rejected my request.

I went home take a closer look and discovered that the reason why the sim card tray was unable to slot in us due to a pin had jack up.

I use a thin tool to press back the pin. After that I am able to slot in the sim card tray.

Okay so i booked for 1 pax so 1 bed. Okay i know its my fault that i stayed overnight because firstly it was already late and its ramadhan so i decided to overnight because it was late. The staff was soo rude shouting at us in the morning 9am and threatening about immigration and stuff . Instead of listen to what we have to explain , he was shouting like as if we are animal and chase us out without hearing our side of explanation.BE ABIT REASONABLE.
Also he threatened us not to ask for refund if not he will call immigration.
This is simple problem we didnt harm anything.
Im Singaporean and my fiance is a foreigner.
I booked separately 28feb-4march for 1 pax.
4march-5march for couple for me and my fiance to stay because we flying off the next day and he told us “DONT TRY TO REFUND OR ELSE I REPORT TO IMMIGRATION “ .
Dont misuse immigration in this situation because we dont harm anyone or anything. Just listen to our explanation and not shouting like a hooligan and threatening us. Settle in a human way and respectful. Just be professional, talk properly next time. Dont talk anyhow and shouting because we dont harm anything or anyone.  Theres more complains but i think being professional is much more important. Theres no purpose or point being friendly but as an owner or idk what kind of staff you are , not being professional and rude is really a concern. Find other alternatives ways next time and dont anyhow chase people out and threaten anyhow. And learn to listen before shouting",en,5 months ago,2025-03-02T17:25:38.844464Z,Hey Azzy

The first 60 minutes of the massage, were exceptional and highly relaxing. However, the last 30 minutes became noticeably less attentive, as the focus seemed to shift towards promoting expensive add-on services. This shift made the final part of the session feel like a wasted opportunity for further relaxation.

I rarely give 4 stars to a SPA. Kudos to the fantastic Chinese therapists

Only cash, nets and paynow are accepted. No Google or Apple Pay are accepted which is a downside if you intend to pay by visa/master credit/debit cards.

On a positive note, the front office staff were incredibly friendly and efficient, clearly dedicated to ensuring customer satisfaction.
The spa itself boasts a clean and modern setup, complete with private adequately spacious non smelly bathrooms👌🏼, heated massage beds 🔥 enhancing the overall comfort and convenience of the visit. While the initial part of the massage was excellent, the push for upsells in the latter part detracted from the overall experience.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-29T08:42:03.266555Z,Urban Explorer

☕ while it’s the longest coffee we had to wait for (25 minutes from point of ordering, explained that they were calibrating the machine), it’s a decent cup of coffee in terms of flavour - can definitely taste the distinct notes across both of our choices, with me preferring the Columbia variant more.

Location is good, plenty of restos around the corner, the pods are comfy enough and other guests were respectful.

The only gripes I had were there were a lot of long black hairs in the bathroom and in the shoe foyer. As a guy with short hair I found this a bit off as the bathrooms are shared male female. The cleaners did a good job in the morning but probably need to be in there 3-4 times a day to stay on top of it. Also the toilets are in the same cubicle as the showers so most likely the floor is going to be covered in water if you need to use the facilities.

Another thing worth noting is both the shoe and luggage lockers are too small. I wear boots and had to jam them in the shoe locker to get it to close. My backpack didn't fit in the luggage locker either so had to leave it in the luggage storage area in the dorm. This wasn't a major issue but perhaps the lockers could be a bit bigger as there were a few other guests in the same situation. I didn't for one second feel like my gear was at risk though and as mentioned above the other guests were considerate and respectful.

Overall pretty good place for the money and I would stay again.",en,a month ago,2025-07-16T08:12:12.791790156Z,Global Projects

Pods are clean, spacious and comfortable. I am giving 4 stars and not 5 because of the bathrooms - so hot and humid it’s hard to stay in for longer periods of time. They’re also shared between men and women which is fine but a lot of people are using them at any one time and there isn’t enough facilities particularly for showers in the evening time. The shower is right on top of the toilet and the cubicles are small so after someone uses it the entire room is soaked. Also the beeping noise when people come in and out of the room or open up their press inside the pod can be a little annoying during the night but nothing too bad.

Other than that would definitely recommend to stay. They provide amenity bags with towels, slippers, water and ear plugs. Free water refill, tea and coffee in a communal kitchen. The smart TV in the pod is a plus :)",en,2 months ago,2025-06-21T07:55:07.996703029Z,Sophie Simpson

Despite not having a particular ingredient in the platter, Wucas quickly informed us instead of replacing without us knowing or consent. In addition, despite the minor issue of the microphone used in the hall area (open space) was faulty, she noticed and thoughtfully moved us to an available room (as per hall charges of min spending of $20++/pax), since there weren't many guest on a Monday night.

The bed bugs infected mattress was thin and of cheap or inferior quality. The pillow case & bedsheet were non-white (so no guest could see dirts, urine stain … ) and obviously the housekeeping staffs DO NOT bother to change with clean bedsheet & pillow case as well as blanket each time before a new guest check in, and sadly to say, he / she will be sleeping on the same dirty bedsheet, pillow case that hasn’t been changed, perhaps more than 3 consecutive guests have used the same dirty unhygienic bedsheet & pillow case in the past check-ins. Shockingly and uncomfortably that there’s ONLY one bathroom and toilet each for 2 rooms of at least 12 guests ( if full occupancy ) which was annoying as guests had to queue. Some of the guests were permanent locals, either with personal problems or avoiding being homeless, and seeking refuge in CSW.

There is barely any common space, one microwave for cooking, and there is one toilet and one shower for - I think - 16 people. From 10 to 8 there were older men snoring pretty consistently. But the sort of snoring that needs to get seen by a doctor - heavy breathing that does not sound normal. I haven't slept this badly in a long time. Then in my room there were two guys who had no respect for the need for quiet after 10 or so and were up at 5 in the morning to work.  Rustling bags and being loud. It is very easy to be loud, to be fair, on the cheap creaky bunk beds. There's a reason it's the cheapest place you've found. Staff were very nice however!

Mentioned by her even tho there's no queue, that the personnel who took order was very rude and it cost $6.20.

Gave everything benefit of doubt, opened the take-away cover and wow. Can literally count the pieces of meat + 1 slice of cucumber from a glance. Roast pork small and Char-siew thin.. sauce stingy, rice hard and dry. Taste subpar.

The rental must be so high that they dare to scrimp-sell like this.

Only about 5mins walk from Harbourbay ferry terminal. The staff are very nice and friendly. They answer questions politely. There is a 24hour halal chicken rice shop next door. Next to it there is a 24hour mart.

We got a standard room, which is surprisingly clean and neat, albeit a strange stain on the bedsheet which we understand might have been difficult to remove but should not have been reused to make the beds. Bed and pillow are comfy. Aircon was awesome. Hot water is good too. Water pressure is reasonably alright. There is a weird smell coming from the drainage when you let the water run though but it is not all that overwhelming.

We can see that they actually make an effort to keep the place clean. We got a non-smoking room but the smoke smell still enters the room at times but that is not a big issue to us.

Be warned that this place has no elevator. We had to carry up our suitcase 3 floors.

Overall, we are happy with the stay. Surprising, as we usually do not take standard rooms due to fear of being unhappy with the stay. But i can say that this place, although it is cheap, lived up to standards of a basic hotel.",en,a year ago,2023-12-30T05:58:38.778109Z,Shaznime

Tried Nine Days again.  Happy to say the rooms are cleaned daily once again.  As Harbour Bay develops, (and Grab and Gojek are present), this location is more convenient as a base in Batam.

I regularly stay here during my visits to Batam but will probably need to find an alternative soon.

They have stopped daily cleaning of the rooms!!! 😡

Checked in last night.  This morning I mentioned to reception that my room is available to be cleaned on my way out to grab a bite.  On my return, I was told that the room can only be cleaned tomorrow as they only clean rooms once every 2 days.  😡🤦

It was a lazy afternoon and it took me a 2️⃣ passes before I decided to queue for it, cause there is always a queue! (And a long one)

Café : You start queuing from the right ➡️ hand side, past the roasting  🫘room and eventually reach the cashier 👨‍💻 to place your order. There are limited pastries 🥧🍰🥐on sale and the primary focus is on their coffee ☕️ which uses 💯 Arabica Beans.

The café itself has an outdoor seating 🪑area that fuses to the side 🏘️ walk of 313 Somerset and it is clean 🫧🧼, spacious and brightly 🌟 designed to allow lots of natural ☀️ light in. It bears an interesting design concept whereby the dining areas are cross facing, stool, bar, table, cozy corners all rolled into one. (You gotta check out my pics 📸 and videos 🎥!) It created a non-consistent functional design that doesn’t force the diners to face only in one direction. Sort of like control chaos, Love 🥰 It, it’s so cool! 😎

Staff : One single staff 💁‍♂️member took my order 📝. Pretty straight forward ….. Coffee ☕️ + Size and pay 💳. He was friendly but didn’t recommend me anything else.

Coffee : I ordered a Café Latte and it was a wicked cup 😃! If I’m not mistaken, they are using a Slayer coffee machine and it pulled a great 👍 shot of espresso! Its coffee ☕️was not overly hot 🌡️, aromatic and super rich. If I could get a table and have more space, I would have tried the pastry and an Americano. Oh well, next time then, I would really love ❤️ to sit down and soak it in.

Coffee lovers, if you haven't yet visited % Arabica, it's time you did. With 8 outlets across Singapore, this famous Kyoto-born brand brings world-class brews paired with their signature clean, minimalist aesthetic — a perfect zen retreat for any coffee break.

They are having an Earth Day promotion: a complimentary Oatside oat milk upgrade for any beverage from 17 April to 15 May! A small but meaningful step to celebrate our planet with every cup.

Caffe Latte (Hot) - Single Origin ($7.40 for 8oz, $8.40 for 12oz)
Made with rotating beans from Ethiopia, Brazil, Nicaragua, or Costa Rica, the latte was smooth and full-bodied with fragrant toasty notes. It had a creamy mouthfeel, sweet milky flavour and a pleasant bittersweet finish that lingered gently. It glided down like a dream, warm and comforting, perfect for a relaxing afternoon.

Dark Latte (Hot) - % Arabica Blend with Oatside Oat Milk ($8.90 for 8oz, $9.90 for 12oz)
This was love at first sip. The bold roasted coffee mingled beautifully with deep, rich dark chocolate notes, capped by the smooth, creamy oat milk. The drink had a strong earthy aroma, balanced sweetness, and a mild bitter hint — almost resembling a mocha, but with more depth and elegance. Robust, smooth, and deeply satisfying, it's a must-try if you love a rich, chocolatey profile without overwhelming acidity.

At % Arabica, you get to choose between their proprietary espresso blend (Brazilian and European beans) or their Single Origin beans — all roasted to a medium to medium-dark roast that strikes a sweet spot between boldness and smoothness. Every cup is brewed with precision, staying true to their philosophy of simplicity, quality, and authenticity.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-28T22:14:31.449648Z,Zi Xuan Lee

For drinks, the pretty-in-pink Coffee & Rose bandung-inspired cocktail, garnished with rose petals, was perfect for a girls’ night out! The Rum Rabbit, infused with White Rabbit milk essence was surprisingly not too sweet, with a strong rum base and a smooth, creamy finish.

The highlight of the night was the tender and juicy Duroc Pork Chop, served with roasted potatoes, sautéed spinach, and savoury apple jus. The Truffle Duck Pie Tee was a delightful surprise, filled with rich duck confit, sofrito, and truffled mash.

We also loved the umami-rich Capellini with Prawns, though it got a little oily towards the end.

I stayed in the 16-bed room and I like how the corridor was spacious enough that I could open my luggage without blocking other people's path. The pod itself was fine and they provide you with a blanket & towel, plus the locker was wide enough to fit a cabin luggage.

The common room has a pretty well-equipped kitchen and 4 partitioned workstations. There are 3 shower stalls within the hostel's area but the toilets are across the hall outside and I often had to wait because they're shared with the building management's staffs.

Now the biggest downside is the fact that it's located right under a bar that plays live music until way past midnight. This and the room's practically warm AC made it really difficult to fall asleep.

I also found the staffs kind of unwelcoming as they just stared at me when I came in and waited for me to speak first. Past reviews mentioned how friendly the staffs are though so I suppose this isn't always the case.",en,a week ago,2025-08-19T16:06:19.596992910Z,Ilana Maressya

Location was great, as it was only 5 mins walk to/from Raffles Place, a hawker center, and the bus stop to go to Sentosa……but not so great because it is Clarke Quay.

I stayed Mon-Wed and you can still hear the music from the bars. They do provide you with headphones but I could still sleep without.

But what really made me rethink was there was puke outside of the lift on my first night. It’s not exactly the hostel’s fault but there’s always that risk when you’re staying in an area where there are bars.

I still think it’s great value for money, because I really was just there to sleep. Wish the receptionists were a bit friendlier tho!",en,a month ago,2025-07-27T03:57:12.517264748Z,Ratri Arifin

The pork jowl was tasty: plenty of chicken rice topped with fragrant and fatty pork and Char Siew sauce, like the kind you get in actual hawker char siew rice stalls. However, if you don’t like the strong taste of pork, this may not be for you.

The rice bowls are also very filling. Do share if you are a small eater. Or if you have a bowl to yourself, avoid ordering sides.

We had the Hot Chicks platter. The best was the Mala Karaage. There was also a honey/bbq wing and a deep fried batter wing, with a hint of lemon but it was quite muted.

Price wise it was acceptable. The cheapest rice bowl is the roasted chicken at 9.90. Then the rest around around 11.90-13.90.",en,a year ago,2024-03-21T16:26:53.972964Z,sy lee

I was trying to be polite by making a small talk with her, so I casually asked her if Tillamook is a new Cheese brand. But her response really shocked me.

She turned her head in a dramatic slow-mo, rolled her eyes at me as she said “huhhh……?” “no…..?” “It’s been around for so long already, you didn’t hear before meh?” She said so much yet she could not tell me exactly which year was the brand founded.

So she was rude and judgmental towards me when I have not heard of the brand, yet she herself as a promoter of Tillamook, don’t know when it’s founded?

Isn’t the point of being a promoter, to promote and share more about the brand to customers? What’s the point of hiring one when the promoter was so judgemental yet clueless about the brand?

I’m sure the reason why she’s even hired to promote at the temporary booth at CS is because the brand is unpopular and they want to make it known to CS customers, so it’s not surprising that I haven’t heard of the brand.

This encounter with the female promoter really ruined my shopping experience at CS. I’d rather patronise Fairprice Finest in future.

Edit: Just to add that I’ve sent a feedback to CS via email and their response felt really templated and insincere. I’m just disappointed.",en,a week ago,2025-08-17T13:55:15.002454144Z,J H

Our family had an absolutely magical time aboard SkyHelix Sentosa, a scenic open‑air gondola ride soaring up to 79 metres above sea level, offering uninterrupted 360° views of Sentosa, Keppel Bay and the Southern Islands  ￼.

From the moment we stepped in, the thrill set in—not only do your feet dangle freely, but there’s a gentle spiral motion to the ascent and descent that lasts about 12 minutes, with roughly 10 minutes at the peak soaking up the views and breeze  ￼. The fresh sea air, cool wind in the hair, and the serene panorama made for incredible family selfies at sunset.

Each ticket included a complimentary non‑alcoholic drink or souvenir, and our family happily chose drinks—mocktails crafted by the Dusk Bar team that were tasty, refreshing, and a fun perk to enjoy mid‑air  ￼. A snack bar onsite also offered pastries, juices, and light bites if you want something extra before your flight  ￼.

Our ride host was warm, engaging, and even helped us take photos while pointing out landmarks—not to mention cracking a few jokes to keep the mood light and fun (). The entire experience felt effortless—from photo ops to boarding, we felt well‑looked after.

A few important notes:
•	While the ride is family‑friendly, there’s a height minimum (1.05 m) and young children must be accompanied by an adult  ￼.
•	Lines can get long during peak times and line management could be smoother—online booking is a smart way to skip the queue  ￼.
•	On particularly windy days, avoid loose items like hats or selfie sticks—and remember to secure your camera wrist strap or phone  ￼.

⸻

👍 Highlights:
•	Mesmerizing 360° views at 79 m elevation—city, sea, islands and jungle all in one sweeping glance.
•	Family‑friendly experience with safety, snacks, souvenirs, and hosts who make it truly engaging.
•	Evening rides lit up with LED lights add extra sparkle to Sentosa’s skyline post‑sunset  ￼ ￼.

👎 Minor Quirks:
•	Occasional long waits if you haven’t pre-booked—line management could use improvement.
•	Seating arrangement faces inward so neck‑twisting is needed to catch the best views (some reviewers found this awkward) ().

⸻

Overall Rating: 5 stars

We visited SkyHelix Sentosa in the morning, hoping for something fun or unique, but left feeling a bit underwhelmed.

The experience involves sitting in a parachute-like open-air gondola that slowly ascends into the sky and gently rotates to offer a 360° view of Sentosa. It lasts about 10-15 minutes. During that time, an instructor gives a short introduction and tries to entertain the group, which was nice, but there’s only so much you can do in that span, especially when the ride itself is very passive.

This is not a ride or anything adventurous. There’s no adrenaline rush, no surprises, just a slow ascent, a calm view, and a slow descent. The view in the morning was okay, but not particularly spectacular. Maybe a sunset or night session would be better for photography or ambiance.

That said, this attraction is suitable for people who aren’t into adventure or thrill rides and are just looking for a mild, scenic experience. It's peaceful and easy, making it ideal for families with young kids or older folks who want a simple, elevated view of the island.

Overall, it’s a decent, short activity, but if you're someone looking for excitement, SkyHelix probably won't deliver that.",en,a month ago,2025-07-29T12:13:46.213098329Z,Asmita More

Dunlop Street was divided into three sections: the commercial section nearest to Serangoon Road, the Chiau-wan (Hokkien) in the middle part, and a Muslim enclave at the Jalan Besar side.

There was even a indian bachelor dormitory housing a hundred or so Singapore Traction Company, Singapore's first public  bus company. Their Friday night community sing-song sessions served as an eye-opener and raucous entertainment for their neighbors.

Yes, and lived harmoniously from colonial days (1950s), through Malaysia, and finally Independence (1959).

As the area evolved into Little India, the Chinese started moving out, and the Arabs owners started leasing shops to Indian merchants.

Today, it is still the place where visitors can savor almost authentic Indian snacks and ""lost arts"" such as hand weaved floral garlands and parakeet fortune masters.

The loss of yesteryear is replaced by the frenetic pace of gentrification and footwork of wide-eyed tourist.

Who is Dunlop anyway? Who cares.",en,a year ago,2024-03-04T06:19:09.872621Z,CCS

We got hungry, so before entering Rumours we asked if they had rice. Since they confirmed they did, we decided to go in for some rice and grilled food.

Upon entering, we chose a high table, but there were only three chairs for our group of four. I asked the server if she could get us another chair, but she told me to ask other guests myself since they had taken the extra chairs. I let it slide and ended up requesting a chair from other diners!! We also asked for table lamps and she replied in a pissed tone that we have to wait! I don’t mind waiting but I guess she was not really that accommodating!

Once seated, the server informed us that we had only 10 minutes to place our order. We couldn't find rice on the online menu, so she offered to assist us. My friend jokingly said, ""Oh, Ms!! Rice please—four rice!"" because, of course, there were four of us, and we were starving. That was the main reason we had chosen this place!

However, when the food arrived, she handed us only one cup of rice and said the kitchen had already closed. The rice was warm and looked freshly cooked, so we asked for more, but she refused, saying kitchen is closed and there was no more rice. She even brought out the chef to confirm that only one cup was available. We had ordered a lot of meat specifically to eat with rice, only to find out they couldn’t serve any more!

In the end, four of us had to share that one cup of rice. If we had known they wouldn't serve us enough rice, we wouldn't have dined there in the first place. We were already hungry, and by the time we realised what was happening, we were just plain “hangry”! The service could have been much better—clearer communication and a little effort to accommodate guests would have made a huge difference. Kati tried service recovery but not I guess it was already too late!",en,6 months ago,2025-02-02T03:27:37.515684Z,Marie Nuelvi Pecho

They were honest and genuinely told me that it was pointless to fix the phone compared to other shops.

14 years later I tried finding the shop at where it was 14 years ago when both my Iphone 12 mini and wife's Iphone 13 mine were both down. But the shop has moved to 4th floor and didnt look as what it was 14 years ago.

But the service was still top class.
Iphone 13 mini was beyond repair due to hardware and would be expensive and not work.
Iphone 12, the charging port, excess dirt was dug out (without charging me) and changed to new original batt coz I was having to charge it 2-3 times daily after years of usage.

Thank you Sir for your good work and honesty.
I hope better days will come for a good company/person like you.

Fixing a phone for him seems more easier than eating a banana like for real.
I was using IPhone X for almost 6 years so everything inside my phone is damaged already. And one time, my phone got freeze so I came to this guy and he fixed that for me. Apple said it would cost 400 dollars and this guy charged me 20 dollars. Back of my phone was broken as well and he don’t have a new back for my phone so I have to go out and buy one.
So I went to another shop afterward to repair the back of my phone which was the worst decision I have ever made. Cuz they damaged my volume button which is essential to restart the phone if ever got freeze again. After this shop my phone got freeze for the second time.
So I came back to this guy and he fixed it for free but he recommend me to change a new one. But stubborn me was so delusional and keep using it. My phone got freeze for at least once a month and total would be around 4 times. And this guy didn’t even take money for most of the time.
So that, I write this review. Thank you Man and Thank you for your service to my phone haha",en,8 months ago,2024-12-11T06:00:57.178536Z,Dominique Ho

Brought my iPad Pro to see if it could be revived from its sudden demise.

Unfortunately while the repairman (sorry, I forgot to get your name!) managed to reboot it,  it couldn’t be brought back to life as there was an additional issue with the screen which would require a >$300 replacement. The repairman recommended that I go for a new iPad instead since my iPad Pro is already 8 years old.

I wasn’t charged anything for his help even though I offered to pay the $50 for rebooting the iPad. The charge was waived since my iPad couldn’t be repaired.

In this day and age when everything is so expensive in Singapore, I think it is honorable of the shop to have such policies. Certainly I have been ripped off by others for shoddy repairs.

From the moment my wife and I walked into the boutique, T was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home.

I was searching for a special bottle of Time Space: Mastery as a birthday gift during our trip, and while it wasn’t available in-store at the time, T went above and beyond to track one down for me. His dedication and follow-through in securing the bottle were impressive, and I really appreciated his diligence.

Beyond that, T offered us a lovely tour of the boutique, walking us through their stunning collection. He also treated us to a tasting of some fantastic whiskys, including A Night on Earth, a Rare Cask Collection bottle, and the 18 Year Old Sherry Oak Cask. It was an experience that added so much value to our visit.

Thanks to T’s outstanding service, we left with not only the perfect birthday gift but also an unforgettable experience.

Please don't expect Michelin star food. It's the standard bar food that is ment to sustain you when high.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-09T08:56:49.727664Z,Randhir Prem

The floor was damp and sticky. There was snot on the wall and bed. They did not provide any Duvet covers. When we asked to get covers they said they clean the duvets which I doubt it's true. We did not stay there and found another hotel. I asked for a refund and they only agreed to pay half but I only ended up getting 10% back of what I paid.

However, I also want to share my real experience to help other guests and support the hostel in making improvements.

Location:
The location is great. It’s easy to walk to Chinatown, Clarke Quay, City Hall, and several MRT stations.

Check-in Process:
The check-in process was smooth and standard. I appreciated the communication through WhatsApp—it was clear and convenient.

Staff:
The staff are friendly and helpful. There’s a sitting area for guests to relax and chat, which is a nice touch. However, the sofa is very old and damaged. It really needs to be replaced with something more comfortable and in better condition.

Toilets and Common Area:
The toilets are generally clean and in good condition. However, the empty space in front of the toilet looks a bit dull and could be improved to feel more welcoming.

Rooms:
The bunk beds felt a bit short and weren’t very comfortable to sleep in. The pillow and blanket also seemed old and not very clean. I’m not sure if the bed sheets were changed before my stay, which is something very important for hygiene. The curtain around my bed was broken and needs to be repaired.

Shared Shower on the 3rd Floor:
The shower was usable, though some parts of the wall were damaged. Also, no new shower gel was provided during my stay, which should be regularly refilled.

Overall:
This hostel used to be very good—I remember walking by years ago and thinking how nice it looked. But now, it feels a bit worn out and could really benefit from some updates. Many hostels in Singapore have improved their quality, and I hope this hostel will do the same to continue attracting guests.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-14T10:12:46.231952Z,Thanyapong T.

1. Bed is SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE to sleep in. Its hot, (I got top bunk) as the bed is made out of metal and super small (I'm only 5'2(158cm,48kg) but I cant move without disturbing other guests.
2. The microwave is DIRTY WITH BUGS, Dried Big chunks of food😭 Staff should clean it DAILY! just because u PLACED a LABEL TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES, DOESNT MEAN STAFF SHOULD NEGLECT TO CLEAN AT ALL.
3. Agoda Pictures shows food setup as if its got free breakfast, but it isnt! I just hoping they didnt write it in because the picture clearly shows got breakfast setup like other hostels. Just a warn, dont fall for it 🤣 but I came prepared with my own food so whatever. I regret it so much spending my money here. I chose this hostel only bc it has privacy curtain to the bed. There a A LOT MORE BETTER HOSTELS NEARBY. (Atelier, Futura, spacepod)

The ONLY GOOD:
The lounge area got comfy sofa (comfier than the freaking hot metal cramped bed. Got AC but it was turned off when the staff left (its not even 11am to 3pm as they claimed. Its the whole time they not there lol)

His knowledge of Leica cameras really made the whole process not just smooth but enjoyable. Jesmond made the experience feel personal and special—exactly what you’d hope for when investing in a Leica.

They provide the information about the product, share their experience if they have used it, and readily answer any questions that we have - which ultimately, helps us have a clear decision before buying.

Re : Roti Prata w/ Fish head curries

Stall : I-Mohamad Ismail Food Stall #01-104
@ 221A Boon Lay Place Food Centre

Recommended this stall to my Ah Man, as we enroute from home 🏠, sent wife at SGH to NTU… 😅😜

Ordered 2 sets of the same : One Plain + One Egg and DIY their fish head curries.

What’s so good 😊?
Less oily, crispy and crusty on the outside and moist, fluffy inside ! Dipped whichever way U liked best with the lid fish head curries ! Cooked freshly on the spot and always tasted 👅 great 👍 ⭐️

Highly recommended to savoury the goodness of the Repertoire of food choices !

Preview the edited video clip + photos collage to whet your appetite !

Cheers 🥂

And there’s a stall selling nice Ngoh Hiang, aka deep fried stuff seasoned with five spices, facing Boon Lay place.

As for dessert, other than the typical bamboo cane drinks and the many different hawker drinks, there’s an auntie selling assorted soya bean drinks and dessert.

In short, it’s a hawker flair paradise!

Far from being a mere plate of greens, this dish is a symphony of textures and subtle tastes. The sautéed kale arrives perfectly tender-crisp, not limp, offering a delightful earthiness. What truly elevates it is the creamy egg white scramble, which adds a beautiful richness without being heavy, and the crispy sourdough crumbs that deliver a satisfying crunch in every bite.

The Rainbow Rice Bowl, is a visual and culinary delight. The organic brown rice forms a hearty base, perfectly complemented by the unexpected zing of spicy pineapple kimchi – a genius addition that truly wakes up the palate. Sweet potato chips add a delightful crispness, while the daikon and red shiso cress introduce refreshing, peppery notes. The poached egg on top, with its perfectly runny yolk, acts as a natural, creamy dressing, binding all the diverse elements together.",en,a month ago,2025-07-14T06:42:23.079335297Z,Al Lim

I got this place through searching on the internet about backpacker places in Singapore. The browser directing me to see this place and could be booked online. In my opinion, this place is good enough for me to stay in, besides the price is affordable, the place near train and bus stop. If you want to walk it is easy to go anywhere around China Town to see Art shops, night food markets, souvenirs and daily things you want.

The sleeping room and the bathroom are clean and comfortable, nice staff and helpful, and the easy access to come and go to this place.

Highly recommend to come shop with them!",en,2 years ago,2022-12-16T08:21:38.253557Z,Flo G

For all stays, this is easily rank F.
Male toilet is in a very bad state, which I presume for a long time, without reparation.
The smell of the toilet leaked to the reception.
Everything is crammed. The rooms are untidy, perhaps due to a lot of long-term tenants
Locks are for decorations. Not feeling safe while staying.
Customer service is basically nonexistent.
Reception doesn't open until 10 AM, so you have only 1 hour window to check out before being penalised; it closed at 6 PM, despite claiming at 10.

Tucked away in a corner amid the sea of fabulous food stalls is Mei Sheng Guo Tiao Mian (美生粿条面) which sells fishball noodles (only) and they come in $4 or $5. The queue at this stall almost never ceases as it opens at about 7am-ish. The waiting time can be up to 25 mins depending on how many orders the people in front of the queue have.

A $5 order of Mee Tai Mak (or 老鼠粉) in soup  is what I have everytime. For that I have three fishballs, an insane amount of bak chor (minced meat) with thin slices of meat, sliced fishcakes, lettuce and some slices of mushrooms. They have the 冬菜 which you can choose to add yourself. Highly recommended as it increases the savoriness of the soup.

The soup is the main reason why I seldom have the dry version. The fishballs are bouncy, not fishy and have a good bite to them. The back chor, meat slices and fishcakes are the usual run-of-the-mill although the meat slices could have been prepared with pepper. special mention gas to be given to the mushrooms as they are very well-braised. The mushrooms are completely infused with the braise goodness and it is evident as I sink my teeth into it. Not to mentioned the porky lards (best!) and the chopped red chilli packed quite a fair amount of heat too.

I licked clean the bowl every time I have it and it'll leave me wanting to visit again the following weekend. Overall a very good bowl of fishball noodles to enjoy over a weekend afternoon.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-09T10:51:01.928078585Z,Minmin Li

I visited the store on two consecutive evenings, and both times she was very rude and inattentive. She spent most of her shift watching YouTube on her phone and chatting loudly with a friend instead of serving customers. The noise was so distracting that it made the shopping experience unpleasant.

On my first visit, I let it go despite feeling that her customer service was unacceptable. On my second visit, I asked about a beer promotion (“buy 1 get 1”) after seeing a display. She responded in a dismissive tone, saying it was a “big deal for me,” and told me the price would adjust after payment. It did not. I was charged an incorrect price that was not the promotion price. When I requested a refund, she refused, saying the manager was not available.

This happened twice, and I will not be returning to this store again. I hope you take this matter seriously and ensure this kind of customer experience does not happen to others.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-11T14:02:44.977288376Z,kkii Choi

Overall it is an affordable, relaxing and well-ventilated dining destination within an urban oasis environment. They have a few tenants within the space - local delights such as Mee Rebus, Chicken Curry, Nasi Lemak. Italian fanfare (Pizza, Pasta). Ayam Penyet, Satay, Seafood, Hong Kong Congee, Barbecue, Wanton Noodles with crisp, juicy wood-fired roast meats. All these are concepts brought in by Les Amis. For those who want a budget-friendly hawker meal, this is a great destination, especially after your stroll along Botanic Gardens.

The nearest MRT station is Botanic Gardens. You would need to walk about 1km. For those who drive, there are ample parking spaces just opposite the food court (open air and not sheltered). I tried the Nasi Ayam Penyet for $6.50 - comes with a very hearty platter of crispy smashed fried chook with fragrant chicken rice, cucumbers and robust sambal. Also tried the signature Char Siew and Roast Pork platter (all grilled in house over hardwood fire!) with Wanton soup from Laifaba Express.

Last but not least, the most amazing aspect and my favorite is the cashless payment ONLY concept. - via Visa, Nets, Mastercard, AMEX, and PayNow. Environment is also kept very clean with wash basins around and very friendly cleaners (thank you so much).",en,3 years ago,2021-11-11T08:36:11.480246Z,Xin Hao

Only 2 joint shower/toilet cubicles where the toilet seats always wet from people showering and they are tiny. No separated male/female bathrooms.

The place looks great in photos but in reality is so so run down and not very clean.

The female dorm rooms were cramped, tiny wooden bunkbeds, sinking in the middle mattresses and mould on the walls.

Bathrooms were also pretty grim, mould, missing tiles and the shower head was pretty much over the toilet.

2) Had to wait in that dark cold room for about close to 20 mins for someone to attend to us.
3) started late and ended late, cos of this we were late for another appt.
4) Was super unprofessional, both the staffs that attended to us, caMe in super late, did not apologise for that. They were chatting loud throughout in chinese.
Lotion was brought in plastic bowl and paper cup.
Super Hot HOT towel on my leg to wipe off the lotion.
The pressure was super painful depsite multiple face gestures and sounds and reminders to her !!!
She kept talking to her colleague and forgetting the pressure on my leg. We couldnt rest because of this.
5) After the session, they just said thank you and left, did not on the room lights or adjust to make it brighter or whatsoever, they just left ! I almost tripped on the FIXED SCREWS ON THE FLOOR ! Thats beside every couch which you could hardly see in that dark room !

My wife and I visited New V Spa that also provided F&B (charged as part of 'food and facilities' cost) on 28 May 2023. We had an accident over dinner at the Spa.

A boiling mini hot pot was upset by the waiter/ chef when it was served and splashed over my 2 tights. They were scalded by the boiling soup and I was sent to A&E for treatment. A police report was also lodged.

Through the incident, I suffered 2nd degree burns and had to be bandaged and currently still undergoing treatment after 3 weeks.

The management did not call me to express their concern over my injuries and even ghosted me for 2 weeks even when I called up the Spa to look for the bosses.

When the management is finally reached, he told me that he will process the Spa's Insurance Claim for me, when I asked for the Insurance company details and Insurance submission after a few days, the management person ghosted me again.

A management that is irresponsible, don't even deserve 1 star, should have no star.",en,2 years ago,2023-06-20T07:56:33.969968Z,John Lim

I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to your team for making our daughter’s 15th birthday celebration a truly special and memorable occasion.

This was not our first visit to Les Bouchons @ Rochester, as both my children love the flambéed dish—an experience unique to this outlet. We were excited to celebrate our elder daughter’s birthday together as a family and were especially looking forward to the flambéed presentation. However, we were initially disappointed to learn that the staff member who usually performs the flambéed was not on duty that Thursday night, which dampened our celebratory mood.

Sensing our disappointment, our attentive waiter, Mr. Rimo, took the initiative to speak with his manager, Ms. Jacqueline. To our delight, Ms. Jacqueline graciously stepped in and personally prepared the flambéed for our children. Her warm gesture not only lifted our spirits but also added a personal touch to the celebration.

We shared a wonderful laugh during the flambéed session, and as always, the meals were nothing short of perfection. The evening became even more special when other guests joined us in singing the birthday song, creating a heartwarming and unforgettable moment for our family.

Please extend our sincere gratitude to Mr. Rimo and Ms. Jacqueline for their thoughtful service and for going the extra mile to ensure our daughter’s birthday was a joyous and memorable occasion. Your other 2 staff Mr Vincent and Mr Vassan were equally attentive and I truly appreciate the extra kindness your team shown to my family . Their dedication and genuine care truly made all the difference, and we are grateful for the exceptional experience.

Thank you once again—we look forward to returning for more wonderful moments at Les Bouchons @ Rochester.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-23T11:06:52.518512Z,Jessica Choo

The staff attitude was terrible, they were rude, impatient, and clearly not interested in serving customers properly. Instead of being attentive, most of them were just standing around chatting and didn’t even notice when customers needed help, especially with the QR code service.

To make things worse, the ticket machine kept getting stuck and no one bothered to assist unless you approached them multiple times. I even saw a couple among the staff holding hands while working, totally unprofessional.

It’s really frustrating when you’re trying to enjoy your time and end up dealing with such poor service. This place seriously needs to train their staff better and improve their customer service standards.",en,a month ago,2025-07-16T14:43:50.100504518Z,Hilary

No one will come to know till they face the problem. I am not here to say bad or good before you book this hostel read reviews and do it.

Pros: location only
Cons:
1. No lift, if you got room with luggage you have to move on steps.
2. To separate room for changing clothes even for ladies.
3. Very low air condition because they have to serve you in budget.
4. No secure lockers to keep your luggage.
5. No security guard or incharge to check at night time. Any one can enter in to hostel 24/7.
6. Finally reception people very worst behaviour. They are not worried about your travel only their concern is to come in time and leave to home in time. I personally faced this problem in Singapore. My next flight is at 11pm but these people not allowed me to keep LUGGAGE till 6pm. I packed and kept at reception at 10am and gone for outing by the evening they call me and said if I don't come with in 6pm they will through my luggage outside.

This is misleading and feels like a scam to customers. Why display a fake price and give false information? We felt completely cheated. Very frustrating and disappointing experience.

Among the mains, the duck confit stood out as the best. The beef bourguignon and barramundi fish & chips were pretty good too. The sweet and sour sticky pork ribs were cooked just right, but the sauce didn’t quite hit the mark—a different sauce might have worked better.

I ordered the Barramundi Fish & Chips while my partner ordered the Black Garlic Ribeye Steak. The fish was very crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside, while the chips were fried to perfection and wasn’t too salty! The steak was probably the best i’ve ever had in my life! It was so soft and easy to eat. The bone marrow butter paired the steak so well.

We were mindblown at the drinks selection. The creativity behind all the drinks has to be the star of the show! Both my partner and I got edible cocktails! I enjoyed Bubble Bean, which was Hopscotch’s take on Singapore’s local dessert “Michael Jackson”, and the presentation and taste was next level. My partner had a Heartland Signature and it came with a waffle on top! 😱

Definitely a new spot in town where I can have dinner or drinks with friends and family! Will definitely be back for more!",en,3 months ago,2025-05-21T09:41:43.514535Z,Shannon Ho

Alicia's expertise was evident as she guided me through the selection process, allowing me to test out several earpieces and explore their functions, including active noise cancellation. She patiently helped me understand the features of each earpiece and how they would perform in different conditions, such as city noise.

What impressed me the most was Alicia's dedication to ensuring that I found the perfect fit for my ears and lifestyle. She took the time to address all my concerns and provided valuable insights that helped me make an informed decision.

Thanks to Alicia's assistance, I not only found a high-quality earpiece but also gained a deeper understanding of its capabilities. Her professionalism and genuine care for customer satisfaction made my shopping experience truly exceptional.

NParks staff—especially Alan—was very friendly and approachable. He gave an excellent explanation about how the island is maintained and how NParks provides fresh water to it. Outstanding knowledge sharing, Alan!

🏊There are swimming lagoons where you can dip and relax. We had a nice dip in the lagoons. It’s safe to swim, but we recommend bringing aqua shoes or water shoes, as there are some corals and stones in the water.

Shower, foot-washing and toilet facilities are available; and all very clean. There are enough beach stools for us to rest, and even a viewing deck, though you’ll need to climb a few short steps to reach it.

Please remember to bring your own drinking water, as there are no water coolers or vending machines on the island.

The boardwalk is beautiful and we loved the scenic island views.

📱An extra power bank is highly recommended—there are no charging points and phone batteries tend to drain quickly during Southern Island hopping.

From this island, you can enjoy views of other nearby islands as well. It’s also a great place to set up a picnic and enjoy the peaceful sea breeze. There's no BBQ allowed.

We took the first ferry in and we just love the peaceful environment.

There is a small hill that can be climbed and a little tower with free binoculars allowing you to view the surrounding landscape. You can enter the water or simply enjoy the view while sitting on the grass or under one of the shelters with friends, chatting and escaping from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is recommended to bring sunscreen as it can get really hot in the morning, and there is one public toilet with no water cooler on the island, so be sure to bring enough water for hydration. Overall, I would say this is a great place to visit.

Even though they are often understaffed, they are always kind, patient, and professional. They have never been rude to me, and they never doubt me when I report an issue, like when coins do not dispense. If there is any delay in assistance, they always apologise sincerely.

In particular, I want to highlight the cashier lady with spectacles who has been so kind to me since I started visiting about two months ago to destress from work. She patiently taught me how the membership system works and explained how the coin dispensing works.

There is also a very tall male staff member with spectacles who is extremely hardworking — he constantly goes the extra mile without being asked. It’s clear that the staff here work very hard, probably under tough conditions with long hours and modest pay.

I hope the management recognises and appreciates their dedication. Because of these wonderful staff members, I will continue to support this outlet. Thank you for making each visit such a positive experience!",en,4 months ago,2025-04-28T14:08:53.711698Z,Cheryl Foo

The staff were straight to the point, which we appreciated—they gave clear instructions and were attentive throughout, stepping in to adjust us whenever we drifted out of the designated play area. It kept everything smooth and safe without breaking the immersion.

Starting off with the loaded nachos, they were pretty good! Although I was hoping for a slightly bigger portion, the guacamole was a bit on the lighter side, but still a solid starter that goes great with drinks.

The star of the show was definitely the borracho fish taco! The battered, fried fish was crispy, and the mango salsa paired so well with it. Definitely ordering it again!

We also wanted to try some of the non-conventional options like the Cauliflower Frito Taco and Jackfruit Chimichanga. They weren’t bad, but I was expecting the cauliflower to be a bit crispier and have more flavour. The Jackfruit Chimichanga had great spices but was a bit too gelat for a single serving (it felt heavy).",en,a month ago,2025-07-08T15:28:26.280160826Z,Two Spoons One Bite

Price wise is higher than outside.
Crab cost $108 per kg.

The fried bee hoon was not so nice as it was dry and tough.

Order the fried rice with crab meat which is nicer.

The brocolli in broth was nice.. interesting concept to steam the entire brocolli.

Grilled octopus was a tad salty but otherwise tender.

👍👍👍 New stall in the house serving really good Teochew cuisines, including braised pork, organ soups, claypot dishes, etc. Note, one can always place advance order using the Koufu app (which also grants a 10% discount) during lunch hours to skip the queue.

👍👍 Notable mention is the Chicken Rice Stall. Meat portion is generous, rice is fragrant and what more, get a bowl of soup for each rice order!

👎 Avoid the Indian Cuisine stall at all costs. Expensive and portion is pathetic (3 small cubes of mutton for Mutton Briyani).

⚠️ Economy rice is not really economical after all, these 3 dishes cost me $8.

⚠️ Prawn noodles is a whopping $5.90, and comes with 2 prawns, 2 tiny slices of pork and fish cakes (added 2 fishballs which cost $1). *Stall closed down for good, replaced by new Teochew Lao.

👍👍 Nasi Ayam Penyet, can choose from different types of chillies (green, red). They even grilled chicken (Ayam Bakar) which comes with BBQ sauce.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-16T05:07:01.734428Z,Jason

🟩 The kiosk food counter staff at Koufu ( Fusionopolis) were mostly efficient. They work very quickly and dish out your food fast, as it is a hawker-centred culture.

🟪 The Koufu here offers a wide variety of food options, including Asian and Western dishes.  ● We had tried out different stalls over a few times. 🔵 And generally the dishes were flavourful, and the prices very reasonable ( as it's a foodcourt)

🟨  The food court can get very busy during peak hours, so be prepared to wait in line or grab a seat quickly.

🟠➡️ Restrooms ( male/ female)  are nearby. The lavatories are generally clean and well lit.

I brought my phone down the same day and was really impressed with how fast and smooth the repair process was. The best part is their pricing — other shops quoted me between $400–$700, which felt unreasonable, but Zhangxin Repair offered a much more honest and affordable rate. Their service is reliable, transparent, and professional. I’m very satisfied and will definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a trustworthy phone repair shop.",en,a week ago,2025-08-19T18:08:22.166882877Z,W Y

Decided not to ditch my iPhone 12 by giving it a new life, battery replacement. Started communicating on WhatsApp at 11AM, booked a slot, handed over phone at 1:30PM, collected at 3:30PM.

As always, they deliver. Just I wish when the repair queue gets longer, I wish there is a dedicated queue for collection.

However, my experience with them was superb, friendly and professional staff made my wait a short breeze.

Always worth to check them out, they will never make you feel obligated over your queries till you decide for yourself.

Waiting time too long. If you are going to have a reservation service, then be truthful to it. Even if you reserve a time slot, you have to wait in a queue. The queue is confusing, and people come in and cut the queue because they are unsure about where to queue.
2. Incompetent staff. I have to be the one correcting them. They don't have information immediately and have to check their ipad repeatedly. While speaking, other staff interrupt our conversations regarding doubts, don't they all have the same experience? Can't they resolve problems by themselves?
3. Trade in prices are poor and old. Wanted to trade in a basically new phone for a used but pristine phone. Bought phone for 1300. Will get up to 750 if trading in opened and activated within 14 days. Okay sure I thought to myself even though it was almost half the original price because of a phone I wanted which was 850 pristine used. Upon giving it. They say it's used and come down to 650. What nonsense. That other phone I want is also used and it's only going for 1000 brand new online same with my phone which also goes for 1000+ online. 650 for a flagship phone that was opened and activated under 14 days and is purely clean with no marks scuffs etc and 848 for a phone that is 4 months old, with mild wear and tear and has only a few months of warranty left is poor pricing given the price you can get these phones for brand new. Update your trade in prices and used phone prices keeping in mind the cost of the phones brand new. Was looking forward to getting that phone so much so that I was willing to accept the 848 asking price. But trade in of 650 for a practically new phone is upsetting.
4. Asked sales rep to get manager to discuss this. Sales rep says just keep your phone. Did I ask? And If I wanted to why would I come to this store. Once rep went to get manager, manager is apparently so busy that he used this sales rep as a messenger to go back and forth.  Manager must be busier than Tim Cook.
5. I was appalled by this lack of support and service and that I couldn't get the device I wanted.
6. I gave one star just for your repair services. You only charge for the repair if you can properly diagnose and fix the issue. I didn't test this but other positive reviews support it.
7. Negotiation is non existent. They follow fixed prices made up by some other department that clearly doesn't know the value of devices. They have no empathy either, I came a long way to this outlet just for that phone. If I am buying a used device or selling a device, I have to give my opinions and reasoning. If it makes sense then you have to do something to please the customer.
In an overview, You lost a potential lifelong customer. Only come here if you want to either be disappointed or repair your phone. Thanks for taking time to read my review.

Throughout our session, the system was unstable — microphones had constant static and dropouts, and the TV emitted a strange echo. This disrupted our experience and wasted our time. I reported these issues to the staff, who came twice to assist, but the problems persisted.

What’s more frustrating is that this isn’t the first time I’ve experienced such issues at Teoheng. Since there were empty rooms available, they could have easily resolved the problem by moving us to another room while troubleshooting.

To make matters worse, a staff member asked me to “just sing a little” to test the mic — even though it was clearly their equipment at fault. As a paying customer, we are here to enjoy ourselves, not to act as free tech support.

After almost 30 mins of troubleshooting, they finally came in to ask if we want to change room. Good luck to anyone who gets Room 9 - smallest room that fit 2 pax.

We pay $60 to enjoy our time, not to troubleshoot equipment problems. I sincerely hope the management takes this feedback seriously and improves the system. Will I return to this outlet? Unfortunately, no.

I share this feedback sincerely in hopes that future customers can have a better experience.

Thank you.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-19T15:59:54.351427630Z,amandaaa

The food? Honest, hearty, and made with soul.

We started with their hamburger steak. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, steeped in a gravy rich with history and home-cooked comfort. It paired beautifully with fragrant home made roasted potatoes on the side.

Another order is cheese and ham omelette. It’s just good old omelette. We also ordered fried banana with honey as dessert. Not overly sweet, just the way grandma used to make it.

Service was warm and unhurried, much like a visit to a relative’s home. The staff took time to share the stories behind each dish, which added to the charm.

The old-school aesthetics, tucked away from the usual Singaporean urban sprawl, are truly interesting and create a unique atmosphere.

I can definitely see why older generations would enjoy the major throwback this place offers. 😲

The abundance of well-maintained vintage decor contributes perfectly to the nostalgic and rustic vibe. The owner and service staff were also very friendly, and even the laminated menu felt authentically old-school with a surprisingly wide variety of dishes, from Western to traditional Chinese and Malaysian dishes.

We opted for the Western pork chops. While the porkiness was a bit strong, and for my liking, the accompanying sauce was excellent, as were the handmade potato wedge chips. The peas and mushrooms were satisfactory.

Water is not complimentary, and they only accept cash payments – no QR codes or credit cards, so come prepared.

The price point of $14 for our pork chops felt rather expensive for the quality of the food, which I would describe as mediocre. You're definitely paying a premium for the unique environment and the overall experience.

The cleanliness and organization of the space were commendable, and the gentle breeze made for a comfortable outdoor dining experience (though sheltered). However, be warned: there were quite a lot of mosquitoes due to the outdoor setting. I highly recommend bringing mosquito repellent to fully enjoy your meal.

Overall: This place scores high on its unique and well-maintained nostalgic ambience and friendly service. 👍

However, the food quality doesn't quite match the price, and the cash-only policy and mosquito issue are significant drawbacks to consider.

Come for the vibes and the trip down memory lane, but be prepared!",en,3 months ago,2025-05-17T13:45:35.687079Z,Yi Ling

There’s a column with a sign that shows “ION Sky via L4”.
On the 4F, look for the ION Art Gallery. You need to enter the area to be able to go to the elevator that would take you to the 55F.
On the 55F, turn right upon exiting the elevator, and that’s it!

Great spot for a quality coffee break in the heart of Orchard! Alchemist has a simple yet well-designed ambience—tidy, minimalist, and with its own unique character. The menu sticks to the classics, and I usually go for their iced white coffee. The flavor is well-balanced, with a light acidity that I personally enjoy.

Though I ordered takeaway, there’s a cozy dine-in space with some pastries available as well. The location is super convenient, right next to Paragon Mall, making it an easy go-to for a proper coffee fix in Orchard.

And it really is one of the important,  because she built rapport in client and she really communicate well. Also, booking schedule is so easy with her. She will do her best to give you the schedule that you requested and what’s fit to your busy schedule . Being comfortable in massage area is one of the imperative, if you will be relax or stress. 😍 so I found  myself relax here. Here in Javanese West Coast . And I always chose them.

Her technique was spot on, and I left feeling lighter and more relaxed. Though her English was limited, it didn’t matter — she really knew what she was doing.

The receptionist on duty, Sherri, was super friendly and easy to talk to! It reminded me of how my aunt and I would converse with each other and I like that — feels familiar to me! She told us about the different packages available, but she wasn’t pushy at all which I really appreciated.

The place itself, although small, had beautiful Indonesian-inspired decor, and the ambiance was so calming — reminded me of those Bali spas my husband and I adore. Even for a last-minute 9pm booking, it felt like the perfect little retreat. Thank you so much for being accommodating to our last-minute booking too, as we really needed a massage so bad after the past exhausting and early couple days of work 🙏✨ We’ll definitely be back!

They also told us about the specials and 1for1 cocktail deals that they had.

Ordered the truffle parmesan fries for starters and we were pleasantly surprised by the distinct truffle taste coupled with just the right amount of salty parmesan flakes. The taste was not overbearing and the fries were fried to crispy perfection

We had tiger prawns and bacon and mushroom carbonara pasta for our next items. The prawns were fresh and succulent topped with a tasty sauce while the pasta was rich and creamy. Presentation was 10/10 as well which enticed us to snap many pictures to show off to our friends.

We ended off our dining experience with a Rib-Eye main which was medium done. The meat was soft and had a smokey finish to it, complemented with nice garden greens and a great barbecue sauce to top it all off.

We ended our night with the aforementioned 1for1 cocktails which were stronger than expected and mixed really well.

Overall, a really chill place both inside and outside of the restaurant.

7 Wonders Boutique Capsule is a great choice for budget travelers looking for a clean and convenient base in Singapore. Yes, the rooms are super small, the bed length is about 1.80 meters, so taller guests should keep that in mind, but they’re comfortable enough for a good night’s rest.

Toilets and bathrooms are shared, but there are more than enough facilities available, and they’re kept clean and tidy, which I really appreciated.

One unexpected bonus was the free breakfast, it’s very basic (toast and cereals), but honestly, it was more than we expected and a nice way to start the day.

The location puts you about 40 minutes from all the main attractions by bus or on foot, making it a reasonable and affordable option for exploring the city.

Overall, this capsule hotel offers great value, friendly service, and just the right comfort for budget-conscious travelers in Singapore.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-10T17:17:59.513797400Z,Mike Rbeck

Compared to other hostel and capsule hotel i’ve been staying at:
- quite far from MRT station
- room very small
- beds are hard
- receptionist didn’t check the note on reservations
- receptionist doesn’t clearly explain about the property, I didn’t noticed there is another door that locked after 2am. I have morning flight and couldn’t pick my luggages on the storage room because the access door is locked. How come so many doors at this hostel. Also the staff didn’t tell me about this access door to main lobby and storage room. As I write this, i don’t know i can catch my flight on time or will missed the flight because i need to wait until 7am
- no 24 hours receptionists. Also the property contact number also not 24 hours. I don’t know it something important or emergency at this property, how can I reach them.
- bathroom space also small
- many dust and rust

Plus point:
- near from Mustafa Center
- many restaurants nearby
- near bus stop

I highly recommend this inn to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, and friendly place to stay. I’ll definitely come back on my next visit!",en,a week ago,2025-08-22T00:40:41.605442276Z,Daphne Tallorin

After a good experience first time car servicing here in Oct 2024, I contacted Sheik, in the morning, as my car had an overheated alarm came on the previous evening.
He told me to check a few parameters that morning, and after doing so, I reported to him. I called him again to ask if I could send my car in at 0939 and he agreed.
Upon arrival, he told me to go home to await their diagnosis, I refused.
After an initial check, he told me that the price to resolve the overheat problem would be made known before lunch, I said that I would wait for it. A little later, he changed it to after lunch. He kept asking me to go home to wait.
I wondered why he agreed to receive my car at 0930? I even spoke with his ‘manager’ but to no avail. I wasted 1h there!
Thankfully, I went to Weng Fatt car workshop whose boss changed the radiator fan and serviced my car within the same day. Air con was good after the fan change. It only cost me $410.
On the contrary, Sheik tried to tell me they needed 1.5days or more to investigate and resolve the overheating and the related warm air con issue. I am glad I walked out before I spent thousands of dollars and a minimum of 1.5 days there.

3/7/25 update:
The customer service staff called me today, requesting me to give a full description of what happened on 20/5/25. It took me all of 23 min 😅.
The long and short of it was to request me to amend my review. I told her I would come here to read, and if there is any inaccuracy, I would amend. I have not found any.
When I first visited this page to write my review, I found it odd that my experience was super unique, with no one having a bad experience except me, after scrolling through about 10 reviews.
I now know why.
The staff offered me to return for a service recovery, at Braddell or whichever centre I chose. She also suggested removing my review. The most shocking of it all was : the said ‘manager’ I mentioned in the review was not a manager at all! 🤦🏻‍♀️
I hope my review provides some semblance to the ‘near perfect’ ratings as shown as i am a consumer and I appreciate businesses that are ethical, honest and transparent. I believe the public would too, and deserves to know the truth.
I truly hope that Comfort delgro, a listed parent company, would seek to clean up their act, and not allow bad characters to tarnish their reputation.",en,a month ago,2025-07-03T14:40:19.763189428Z,Joanna Lee

When we came into the room, the room wasn’t even set-up yet. Then when it was, we went on to try out the systems. Initially there wasn’t any sound. After resetting the system we realised that the touch screen wasn’t responding.

We were eventually moved to another room. I understand that the staff is new, but come on, why would you leave a new staff to tend to the whole outlet all by himself?

I’ve never been to a KTV where the systems were not functional at the point of us entering the rooms. Shouldn’t it be tested and ready?

And the worse is that, cause of all this delay, we started late by 20 mins and by right should end 20 mins late. But since the next customer is here, we were forced to leave early, when it’s not even our fault. Totally no attempt for customer service recovery for this..

However, upon my arrival, I was told that there was no record of my appointment in the system. Adding to my dismay, there was not even a doctor present at the clinic.

My partner, who had been to Unity clinic for similar tests, had already shared her concerns about the poor service standards at their front desk.

I was skeptical, but today’s experience left me with no choice but to acknowledge it firsthand. This is, quite frankly, the worst level of service I have ever encountered in a medical setting.

As a patient, one expects professionalism, reliability, and organization, particularly in a clinic where people trust their health and time to the Unity clinic.

It felt less like a regular grocery run and more like walking through a gourmet food hall.

The selection is top-tier. I was especially impressed by the fresh seafood section—they had live lobsters and oysters from Japan and Ireland, and everything looked incredibly fresh. I also picked up some beautifully marbled Wagyu beef cuts from Ryan’s Grocery’s premium selection, and they were absolutely worth it.

Their cheese and charcuterie section is a dream—so many unique options from around the world. I ended up getting a wedge of Manchego with truffle, and the staff even helped me pair it with some cured meats and a nice bottle of wine from their curated wine wall.

What really stood out was how well-organized and upscale the whole space felt. Even if you’re just there to grab a few things, the experience makes it feel special. They even have a little corner with gourmet pet treats—something I haven’t seen elsewhere in Singapore.

If you enjoy high-quality groceries or just want to treat yourself to some gourmet finds, CS Fresh Gold at Paragon is definitely worth a visit. I’ll be back for sure.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-20T19:17:32.469969Z,Fasy Ismail

I like how they segment the fresh produce from the shelf-stuff, and that when you walk in, you'll be wow-ed by what they're strongest in first before the other standard supermarket things follow through towards the cashiers.

Upon reaching home I realised there was a rotten pear in the tray of China Golden Pear, not visible as it was wrapped with a netting.
I communicated through WhatsApp with the store Manager Mr Teo Wee Loon.
Within minutes, a refund was done and money credited into my account. It has saved me the hassle of going back to the store.
Awesome! Such an efficient and customer orientated store manager.
2 weeks later, I went back to the same store to buy 4 cartons of Oatside Oatmilk. I approached Mr Teo and he immediately got Mr Tan Yong Tien to bring out the stock. It was a very smooth transition.
It displayed great teamwork  to assist customers.
Well done 👏

On 3 August 2024, I was at the same store attended to by Ms Chen Suet Ting at the checkout point. When she saw that I have purchased 10's x 5 trays of Kampung eggs which cost me $18, she highlighted to me the good offer of a tray of 30 eggs with a discount of $3 using the POSB Everyday credit card. She even offered to change for me. I didn't take up the offer as I still prefer the Kampung eggs.
I have never experienced such excellent services at other Supermarkets.

I have met Sheng Siong's boss Mr Lim Hock Chee at the Hari Raya Draw event this year. He is indeed a very humble boss. I would like to highlight to him for having such dedicated staffs  with excellent service. My compliments to the 3 staffs mentioned.
Cheers

I was at the same store checking out my purchases at 12.13pm at the counter manned by Ms Jong Su Tjhing. A very patient and efficient cashier, always doing her best to give customers full satisfaction.
Keep up the good work Ms Jong.
Cheers

22 April 2025
This morning around 9.30am,  I Whatsapp store Manager Mr Teo Wee Loon to check on the availability of a product. Despite his busy schedule he responded to my enquiry promptly. What an amazing and customer orientated personel of Sheng Siong.
Keep up the great work Mr Teo!
My compliments go to you.

I recently engaged U Autocare for both routine servicing and diagnostic work, and I must commend the team for their outstanding professionalism, technical expertise, and customer-first approach.

From the moment I arrived, the mechanics demonstrated thorough knowledge, clear communication, and genuine care for vehicle condition and safety. The workshop was well-organised, clean, and efficiently run – a strong indicator of their operational standards.

The mechanics at U Autocare diagnosed an intermittent issue with precision and resolved it without unnecessary upselling. What stood out was their transparency – I was updated throughout the process with clear explanations, estimated timelines, and cost breakdowns.

Key highlights:
•	Technically sound diagnostics with modern tools
•	Transparent pricing and no hidden charges
•	Timely completion with quality workmanship
•	Friendly and respectful mechanics who clearly take pride in their work

U Autocare delivers a level of service that rivals authorised dealerships, at a far more competitive price point. I have full confidence in their capabilities and will continue to entrust them with my vehicle maintenance needs.

Highly recommended for anyone seeking a reliable, honest, and customer-centric workshop.",en,a month ago,2025-07-10T02:47:27.976875803Z,Sharul Nizam

Room is spacious but a little worn-out as is some of the furniture. In the room, one could hear a bit of dj/club music & sound till way past midnight, but it was ok for me (but sound-sensitive sleeper may take note).
Bed is comfortable for me.
TV signal ok with limited channels, about 6 local & 6 Singapore free-to-air channels.
WiFi is unstable though.
Semi-partitioned shower. Good water pressure. Cleanliness is acceptable. Most importantly, no cigarette smoke & sewage smell in room.
However, smoking seems to be allowed in the lobby so it may be filled with very strong ciggy smell.
Some areas can be improved as surfaces were dusty & toilet roll was not replenished when I checked in.
Maintenance can also be improved as the wash basin's tap is loose (although still usable), clogged shower drainage as water takes long time to drain away, water seeping under wash basin causing toilet area to be wet, some slight aircon water drip.
Only oral kit provided. Guests need to get own shower gel, shampoo.
Checking in/out is quite fast.
BUT minus point for me is that the hotel doesn't provide guests the option to leave their luggages temporarily at front desk area. All other Batam hotels I have stayed at, have allowed this small gesture.
Overall I had good rest here.
Would still consider it for its location & value-for-money although lacking in some usual services that I'm used to.",en,4 weeks ago,2025-07-31T06:10:25.449347633Z,Chung O

Budget: Worth the price for a budget room.

Service: The service is good. The room might need some improvements, but you can ask the staff, and they’ll patiently help you.

Internet: It would be great if they improved the WiFi. The connection is bad at times, but sometimes it's good. (Not sure if that’s common in Indonesia.)

The sheets smell like they have been used.

The aircond is not cold even though the temperature has been adjusted to 16 degrees celsius (called the technician to fix it but nothing has changed). Sleep in the heat. It is recommended to perform regular servicing.

I stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights. On the first day of requesting iron until the last day, unable to use iron. Every day request iron but nothing. The receptionist's excuse, the iron was used by other guests. So frustrated, 4 days cannot get one chance to iron my clothes.
It is suggested that if the hotel is unable to provide an iron in each room, please provide an open/public iron room on each floor of the hotel. so guests can go to the iron room if they want to use it. The problem of a guest using the iron for a long time can be avoided. When this kind of incident happens, I wonder if the iron exists or not in the hotel.

Even if you have booked a room for 4 days and 3 nights, the room door access card needs to be renewed every day. Very unsatisfactory service.

The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast buffet provided. There are many varieties and delicious. Its is recommended to try their cooking.",en,6 months ago,2025-02-26T09:01:37.294499Z,Asnida Amri

This cosy café is tucked away in the heartlands, not far from Queenstown Shopping Centre or even IKEA. It’s a great little stop if you're in the area and craving a good cup.

Let’s talk coffee. I had a cappuccino with oat milk, while my friend went for a flat white. My cappuccino had a surprising almond-like aftertaste, which I suspect came from the oat milk enhancing the nutty notes. The finish was smooth and flavourful with a light sweetness, likely from a light to medium roast.

I had a sip of the flat white too. It didn’t have that same almond edge, but it still carried a nice nutty profile. Well-balanced, well-extracted, and the milk was steamed to perfection.

The café itself had a relaxing and cosy atmosphere, with soft background music and a warm, welcoming layout. There were about seven small tables inside with benchtop seating, and a couple of benches outside if you prefer a bit of fresh air.

They serve a small selection of pastries, which seem to be more of a light snack to accompany your coffee rather than a full food offering.

They also sell coffee beans and accessories. If you’re thinking of starting your own V60 pour over setup at home, they’ve got you covered, from beans to kettles. There are also cleaning tools if you already own a coffee machine.

All in all, this place feels comfortable, unpretentious, and good for the soul. It wasn’t too busy during our visit, and the layout made it feel open and inviting rather than cramped.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-05T04:19:10.229556Z,Kim Unji

The 2 hrs is just right to have her knead through every knot, ache and pain spots. My shoulders are not so stiff and my back ache is relieved.

Normally, I don't bother to ask the therapist for their name. But this therapist managed to reduce the stiffness in my shoulders in 1 session and she is always checking if the strength is ok for me. Am impressed by her service and skills, hence, I asked her for her name. So that next time I can request for her to massage for me.

Provided fast and speedy replacement of battery and it was ready in an hour. However, the issue was not fixed after battery was replaced and owner was very understanding after I communicated not wanting to switch the motherboard due to cost constraints.

He suggested exploring a final solution with the charging port and told me he would refund the full amount if it did not solve the issue.

He was true on his word and refunded me the full amount in the end. Excellent service, friendly and honest owner!

Background of the visit begins with my girl dropped her phone while cycling and it cracked terribly.

Hence, upon recommendation from friend, I decided to give Mister Mobile a Whatsapp to book an appointment to change the entire screen ($65 for Oppo A77S). Their pricing is transparent and listed on their website. My apprehension on exorbitant price after repair is greatly reduced.

I had to visit Bishan outlet as the stock was unavailable at Yishun outlet. Compared to Yishun, the vibe was very much like any other mobile phone shop. Bishan outlet replaced the screen within hours.

I had visited Yishun outlet previously due to water damaged Samsung S10E (Choose not to repair in the end as the damage was extensive). I had very good impression of the staff at Yishun outlet as they are not pushy and in fact can explain in details on the damages.

After the repair of Oppo A77S, I realised that the screen had some discoloration at times and brought it back to Yishun outlet instead of Bishan outlet as it was much nearer. The Yishun outlet explained that it might be discoloured due to pressure as it sometimes happened with LCD screen. I was perplexed and they took it in for checking. After 2 hours plus, they tested and there was no discolouration during the period it was with them. They even adjusted the screen more inwards so that the edges are not popping out (it was a little protruding after the repair at Bishan). The staff realised that the power button was a little unresponsive and also assisted to did minor adjustment so that it was easier to press. Really like the service at Yishun outlet.

The staff was friendly, but the second time...

From the first experience, I learned that some stocks maybe available at some locations, so this time, I book an appointment online, as there's a certain colour and storage I wanted. Since there's no new one available, I went for pristine* condition

*Pristine:* The device’s screen is flawless—no scratches at all. The exterior looks like new, with minimal wear that’s barely noticeable. Battery health is strong, at 90% or above, giving you excellent performance. 💎

they confirm with me my order and told me that there were no box for this phone and it's the last one left. I'm not that okay, but since it's the last one left, I guess I'm fine without a box as long as I got the phone in pristine condition with the colour and storage i wanted.

I queue there for around 10-15mins until a staff served me, he confirm with me my order, I bought a case, a glass screen protector, 2 apdapter and a phone, when he took the phone out, I noticed that there were many scratches on the lens. I didn't believe it was scratched until I tried to wipe it off, and it's still there, pristine? barely noticeable? if you are blind then it would be barely noticeable, I don't know what the staff was busying with when he should be serving me at that point, he kept eyeing on the staff next to him like some kpo, I tried to communicate, I said there's scratches on the lens and he threw me with a ""it is like that."" I can't tell if it did or did not affect the quality of the camera and I'm actually not satisfied with it but since it's the last one left I had no choice but to close an eye again. then he told me that there's no glass screen protector... so he pasted the film protector, he applied it twice and it's still horrible. the case was also horrible, it felt like cheap case that can be bought from shoppee for 10cents instead of 10dollars and as soon as I step out of the shop, I got a new case a new glass protector and a lens protector to cover the scratches from the lens and it cost me another $25

during the use of the phone i notice a bubble at the side of the phone, I thought it was from the screen protector until I changed my screen protector today and it was still there, it looks like it's under the screen glass, it's small and hardly noticeable but once it's  noticed i will always see it and I'm not happy to get this kind of condition not told for a pristine price. first, the lens is now the screen. pristine?

I had chatted with the team about this issue, and I hope they won't disappoint me again.

updates :)
The team responded promptly and consistently assisted me in resolving the issue. They gave me suggestion to change to another device as there is none of the same device left, after telling what model I'm keen with they pick the best condition sending me pictures and videos of the conditions of the devices that I'm interested to make sure that I'm okay with it.

even after exchanging, I'm not used to the device, which was my fault, i wanted to refund the device, and Han, the Customer Support Manager who has been constantly helping me, provided excellent support.

I truly appreciated the sincere efforts.  the dedication to customers is commendable. thanks for all the help!",en,5 months ago,2025-03-27T12:55:49.020801Z,taiperni

I booked with this hostel through booking.com (don’t worry, they’ve also received a 1 star review). The accommodation looked nice and legitimate.

I was wrong, this accommodation was a scam all along. They sent me a dodgy link on booking.com’s messaging system, threatening to cancel my booking if I did not fill in my personal information online (which they already had). I of course did not fall for their trick.

I contacted them through booking.com and email, in regards to the situation of my booking and received no response whatsoever.

So I took matters into my own hands and cancelled the booking myself. I requested a refund due to the negligence and appalling treatment they gave me, and sure enough, they were quick to respond to my refund request with a definite NO. Yet, they couldn’t respond to my issues for over 2 weeks prior to my cancellation?

An absolute scam and a joke of an accommodation. My advice, don’t use booking.com as they allow fraudulent hostels such as this, to steal your money.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-18T21:28:47.688871934Z,Jacob Froggatt

It places next to the Aljunied MRT station, only about 5 minutes walk. Some of the rooms have air conditioner, some (downstair) don't. My bed was a bit squeaky, it emitted some noise. My friends and I stayed for 4 nights but on the third evening (after a long day outside), we found they had moved our belongings out of the room (4 over 9 beds), they said they thought we had left. When they realized they were wrong, they tried to convinced us to move to a worse room (with only 2 beds for 4 people) instead of giving back our places. Some other guests were in that situation too (I observed 3 cases), late at night with beds taken, quite unacceptable. There were several bathrooms and restrooms around but they were not really clean, once i caught toilet tissues scattered on the floor. They also didn't have enough locker keys (only 7 available when we asked for 9). My locker was also not durable, I could pull the handle a bit strongly to open after it was locked. We checked out early on the fifth morning and the receptionist was not there but it was a good point that they returned the key deposit money after we left via bank transfer.

I often ask them IT related questions and they will without fail find the answers if they could, they even helped me configure a portable hard disk, partitioning it according to my specs.

I've been wanting to write a review of my experience with Faith and Healing Touch, and now is the time. Been going to Faith for my monthly (sometimes weekly) massages for 10 whole years now. I was her customer since before she even joined Healing Touch, back when she was working with another spa.

For the past ten years, I have had the privilege of receiving exceptional care from Faith, whose hands work nothing short of magic. Each session is a journey to complete relaxation and rejuvenation, where every muscle tension is skillfully addressed, leaving me feeling refreshed and revitalized.

The most recent visit to Healing Touch was to let Faith work out my Piriformis Syndrome, which was diagnosed just 2 weeks ago. The condition affected me so much that I wasn't able to carry out my daily tasks without feeling pain. My movement was limited as well.

Faith informed me that it may require more than a session or two to really see results. But much to my surprise, I was able to walk better and perform my daily routine with ease almost immediately after the initial session.

The receptionists from this branch changes so often. Regardless, the service has always been consistently good and friendly. Would like to thank Diana and Qim for their hard work in making every of my visit an unforgettable one.

In conclusion, if you haven't tried therapist Faith before, I highly recommend you book a session with her and see for yourself what an elite therapist's massage (with nearly 2 decades of experience) feels like. You will not want to visit anyone or anywhere else after this.",en,a year ago,2024-07-10T01:36:24.514853Z,Rachel H

It's pretty amazing to me how she can always pinpoint where my painful and sore spots are and apply the appropriate strength and technique to ease away my painful knots.
Another deciding factor is there is never any hardselling of packages here, not like many other places I've been to in the past.

She relied almost entirely on her elbows. While this can be effective in moderation, she used it across nearly my entire body, which felt lazy and careless. There was no variation or real technique — no proper use of fingers or palms, and when she did use her fingers, there was zero strength. I gave repeated feedback to increase the pressure, but it made no difference.

At times, she would jiggle the flesh on my arms and back — something I’ve never experienced in any massage before, and I go regularly. It was strange, ineffective, and felt like she had no idea what she was doing.

I requested a change of therapist mid-session. The receptionist came in only to say it was already 1.5 hours in and no other therapists were available. She even suggested I switch with my partner — why would I pass a poor therapist to someone else? Most shockingly, there was no apology for the bad experience. Instead, she kept harping on the fact that I didn’t request a switch within the first 15 minutes — a ridiculous expectation, especially for a first-time customer who was trying to give the benefit of the doubt.

Overall, the massage lacked skill, care, and professionalism — and the service recovery was even worse. I left feeling more annoyed than relaxed. A total waste of time and money. I won’t be returning to this branch.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-20T10:17:51.682348Z,Eil

Service was pretty good, they were fast and responsive, and upfront about potential issues.

The repair quality is a bit suspect though - the phone exterior wasn't in great condition to begin with, but it's much worse now. 😅 Lots of glue protruding from different parts, and some scrapes and chipping where it was pried apart. When I open it there's also a slight creasing sound and the closing doesn't look quite right. I still got charged full price for the repair.

But the cable has been fixed and it works! They provide only a 30-day warranty for this, compared to the 90-day for their other repairs, so I will see how long this lasts.

Edit: Dropped a star because their response is quite disingenuous. The screen was damaged prior, but the exterior was totally fine -- and from the photos you can see now that it's quite a mess. That was their doing.

A month on and the phone is holding up all right, but the hinge is a bit wobbly and probably will not last long. Overall I'd say that it's an expensive and low-quality fix.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-24T12:35:44.137194Z,Kai

Her attitude was unprofessional and made the entire experience frustrating. It felt like I was being brushed off. This kind of behavior is unacceptable, and honestly, it feels like a scam when one staff says there’s a promotion, and another refuses it with such hostility.

I’ve been a regular customer at Challenger, but this incident has made me reconsider. I won’t be returning.

Paco Funworld is an absolute gem for both kids and adults! The soft play area is bright, safe, and full of exciting slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my kids happily entertained for hours. The arcade section is just as fun, with a wide variety of claw machines and games at very reasonable token prices.

The place is well-maintained, clean, and the staff are friendly and helpful. I love that there’s something here for every age group, making it a perfect spot for a family outing. Even as an adult, I had a blast trying to win plush toys from the claw machines!

Highly recommend visiting on weekday mornings for a more relaxed experience. Overall, a fantastic indoor play and arcade space in Singapore – definitely worth coming back again and again!",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-12T10:02:23.905685152Z,Thakshi Rusi

I even asked where can I get the phone near to my place and she help me out as well...really appreciate it all.

Lite Mobile (Boon Keng Branch) even made a reservation so that when I get there they have my phone and color I wanted and it was really a great job because even the guy who assisted me was very friendly and suggested shock casing and screen protector so it was like package a one stop shop. To my surprise the casing and the screen protector has a warranty for 6months.

Then proceed to tell me ""ur phone more than 2 years already no warranty"". I told him very nicely ""I'm covered under my warranty and need a diagnosis of the issue and price estimate on paper"", it is so that the warranty company can review. He really just stood up and walk away, and while back facing me tell me ""we don't provide such services"". If taking a pen and paper to write down the diagnosis of the issue and price estimate is a service too much ask for, you can imagine what kind of shop this is. Visit at ur own risk.

We recently hosted our son’s 9th birthday party at X-scap8, and I can confidently say it was one of the best parties we’ve ever had. From the moment we stepped in for a site visit, we were sold. The vibe, the layout, and most importantly—the “Floor is Lava” game—checked every box on our list.

Planning the party was a breeze thanks to the incredible team. Julian was responsive and helpful during the enquiry stage, but the real game changer was Liang. His professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail made all the difference. He understood exactly what we needed to make the party enjoyable for both kids and parents, and he delivered flawlessly.

Liang and his team took care of everything—from coordinating the timing of games, gathering and briefing the children, to managing the cake-cutting and food service. It was one of the most relaxed and well-organized birthday parties we’ve ever attended. As parents, we didn’t have to worry about a thing.

The kids had an absolute blast, especially during the “Floor is Lava” game, which was run with great energy and care. The staff made sure every child was engaged and safe while having fun. Meanwhile, the parents got to unwind in a chill-out area with delicious food and a great selection of drinks—both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.

What really stood out was Liang’s commitment. He was hands-on throughout the event, making sure everything ran smoothly and that every guest—big and small—was having a good time. His passion and dedication were truly impressive.

All the parents who attended were full of praise for the venue. It’s rare to find a place that caters so well to both children and adults, and X-scap8 does it effortlessly. The atmosphere is vibrant, the staff are fantastic, and the experience is unforgettable.

If you’re looking for a fuss-free, fun-filled, and professionally managed venue for your child’s birthday party, look no further. Did I forget to mention they even took care of the party invites as well as the party decorations!

Wonderful location.

Room is spacious.
Good TV signal with many channels.
Mattress is the hard type but comfortable for me.
No cigarette smoke & sewage smell in room.
Bathroom comes with bath tub, no shower area.
Water pressure is strong.

Cons:
Hotel appears dated & tired-looking.
Could hear some traffic noise from main road but still ok for me.
WiFi is alright but sketchy at times.
Only oral kit provided. Guests need to get own shower gel, shampoo.
Feels stuffy in bathroom as no exhaust fan for ventilation.
Wash basin's tap is the presto type. Very inconvenient as no pressing=no water, not practical for hotel setting.
Cleanliness is below average. Many baby cockroaches in room.",en,4 weeks ago,2025-07-31T06:23:51.996834262Z,Chung O

My girlfriend and I stayed here for a few nights. Lotus is brilliant value for money especially in expensive Singapore. We had a lovely clean room and the all round cleanliness of the hostel was great. Its located next to a bus stop which is serviced by a number of local buses all of which can either take you into the city or to the nearby MRT station. The owners of the hostel are so helpful and friendly. I'd definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it.,en,10 years ago,2015-03-09T08:43:21.100Z,Dónal Brady

It can get quite busy during lunch time — both with students, staffs, or people from the offices nearby.

Stalls that have opened include:
1. Drinks/Snacks/Fruit Juice
2. Korean (by Hwang's)
3. Dough Magic
4. Fish Soup
5. Mala Hotpot
6. Chicken Rice (by Sin Kee Chicken Rice)
7. Western Food
8. Mixed Vegetable Rice
9. Mini-Wok
10. Indian & Pizza

For the fish soup stall, I've tried their ban mian and the sliced fish porridge. Both are excellent. The porridge has still a grainy texture and the porridge itself is very tasty. The fish slices are also quite thick. As for the ban mian, the soup base is flavorful and there is plenty of minced meat inside. You can also opt to change the ban mian to mee sua, or any noodle of your liking.

For the mixed vegetable rice, it offers a variety of dishes, but I personally find that they cook their vegetables well. I often order the you mai cai from this stall.

For the western stall, they sell mixed grill, which consists of beef, chicken chop, and fried fish. It was all quite good, and it comes with two sides of your choosing. I tried the butter rice and the butter corn. Both were good, and the butter rice was especially good with the short grain rice they used.

For the Indian & Pizza stall, I tried their margherita pizza. I liked that their crust is just the right thickness and is crispy. The amount of cheese and the tomato sauce were just nice.

For the Drinks stall, they have several homemade drinks on a cup. I tried their green bean soup. I particularly liked how generous they were with the green bean and that the water itself was not too sweet.",en,2 years ago,2022-10-31T17:10:17.006336Z,Edwin S

However the view of Keppel Harbour was good.

I went there again the following morning and it was as early as 8.30am when the tides was low on that very day. (Check the tide schedule to avoid making a wasted trip). The intertidal walk was magnificent and I saw many coral reefs and marine wildlife. There were also pitcher plants found at the cliff area. I learnt that the rock formation dates back to the Jurrasic Period and that there was a dinosaur footprint found there.

Nparks should have created a boardwalk like that of Chek Jawa so that people who goes there during the low tide wouldn't disturb the wildlife,especially the corals and the sea grass",en,5 years ago,2020-07-30T10:00:55.902054Z,gideon lam

A lot of fun, especially with the discovery of Tess Bar! I've been holding off my review to ascertain the consistency of the food and service and today, I felt compelled to write one due to the really tantalising food and drinks. I've tried just about every mocktail here and the standout for me is the Chai Melon! Sweet and tangy, it really is a palate cleanser. The pork jowl linguine was al dente enough and the accompanying sauce was amazing. So amazing that we actually scraped the plate clean!
I also enjoyed the small plates and my Chicken Karaage today was excellently done. The ssamjang sauce gave the chicken an extra punch and I kept eating as it paired really well with the crispy chicken that thankfully was not doused in oil!
Overall I've had a lovely dining experience at Tess Bar. Staff are attentive, quick to refill my water and ensure I have sufficient serving plates, cutlery and serviette.
The overall vibe is inviting and not at all pretentious and I felt so at ease here as I was able to have a conversation without feeling like I could hear the next table.
With the great food, excellent mocktails and warm service, I'm definitely bringing my friends and family here since non-drinkers will definitely not feel out of place here.

This popular stall is well-known for its unique addition of crispy silver fish and vegetables. As expected, there was a queue, so I joined in. The lady stall owner typically takes your order when you're still 2–3 people away from the front. The environment is quite noisy, so if you don’t speak loudly enough, she may get frustrated and ask you to repeat or confirm your order.

I ordered a large plate at $5.50, requested it without cockles, and was served a generous portion that included three prawns, crispy fried silver fish, and vegetables. The dish was tasty and satisfying, with no aftertaste of thirst—definitely worth recommending. However, it would be better if orders were taken only when customers are closer to the front of the queue.

We also ordered a medium-sized claypot rice from Yew Chuan Claypot Rice stall at $15, suitable for two to share. It came with salted fish, Chinese sausage, and chicken slices. The flavors were well-balanced, and the stall owner was kind enough to serve it directly to our table. For those who enjoy more protein, I’d recommend requesting extra chicken—though it may come with an additional charge.

Will definitely explore Golden Mile Food Centre again, as I’ve read there are many other stalls offering delicious food worth trying.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-04T07:45:26.614407Z,N. Gan

Sounded abit sarcastic and say they will say yes without any explanation as we are not aware that its compulsory to wear mask unless healthcare or public transport.

Also the service staff are very assumptions and judgemental when asking questions about how the booking go about. When we ask about the rate is it for an hour or 2 hours.

From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance struck a lovely balance: soft, warm lighting complemented the sleek, modern decor, with touches of classic elegance in the polished wood accents and plush seating. Whether you’re settling into a cozy armchair by the fireplace or grabbing a stool at the bar, the space feels both refined and relaxed, ideal for unwinding after a long day or meeting up with friends.

The drink menu is a highlight. The bartenders clearly know their craft—my gin and tonic was perfectly balanced, with a fresh citrus twist that elevated it beyond the ordinary, and their signature cocktails (try the elderflower spritz!) are creative without being overly fussy. They also offer a solid selection of wines and local beers, ensuring there’s something for every preference.

🟨  My hubby and I went to the Lobby Bar on 21st March 2025 Friday at 7pm for dinner and tea. ● Upon stepping into the bar lounge, I can tell that ""The Lobby Bar"" at Sheraton Towers is a sophisticated haven, perfect for unwinding in style.

❇️ Nestled in the heart of the hotel, this elegant & luxurious lounge has a warm and inviting atmosphere, complete with comfortable plush seating and a very soothing ambience. 🟧 The decor hues here are a neutral palette of colours of white, grey, brown, and black tones.

🔶️ As we settled in for a relaxing evening, I was treated to exceptional service from the attentive staff, Zar Win and Alyson. ▪︎ Zar Win spotted me from her counter spot, and immediately ushered me to a table of my choice.

🟩  The drinks + small bites + ala carte menu boasted an array of tantalizing options, and we opted for the Dry Nonya Laksa and a soothing pot of English Breakfast Tea.  💛 The Dry Nonya Laksa was expertly prepared, with each bite bursting with flavour. ▪︎Paired with the comforting warmth of my tea, it made for a truly satisfying and delightful experience.

🖤 The Dry Laksa is just like how I cooked it at home. Being raised in a true blue Peranakan household, I can tell rightaway the Dry Laksa is a 100% authentic version.🔴 My late Baba father used to tell me authentic Nonya Laksa comes only with the noodles, julienned timun ( cucumber) + udang (prawns).

🟨 Throughout my visit, the service was top-notch – friendly, efficient, and attentive without being intrusive. I spoke to Alyson, the head bartender and manager, and we had an interesting, incisive and insightful conversation on various topics of interest. 😊🙏🏻 I Really love chatting with Alyson. She was so genuine, empathetic, and had an affable disposition.

🟢 So whether you're a hotel guest or just seeking a tranquil spot to unwind, I feel that the Lobby Bar at Sheraton Towers is a great choice. ● Its winning combination of truly delicious local Asian food, exceptional service, and welcoming ambience, makes it an ideal destination for any occasion.

✳️ We will be back again at the bar lounge soon. 💜 Thank you, Alyson and Zar Win, for the omotenashi hospitality rendered to us earlier. ▪︎ This is one of the most wonderful hotel bar lounge I have been to ( because of its service staffs' awesome attitude)",en,5 months ago,2025-03-21T15:56:21.383854Z,Florence Leow

Drop by the KGC workshop due to an unfortunate accident involving my car a while ago. Lincoln, the operation manager were very friendly and extremely professional on providing his view and the quote based on his experience. First time visit but Lincoln  gave me the confident from the conversation and they will always do their very best to fulfil customer satisfaction. So I decided to leave my car there for repair and the outcome was superb. They really did an fine job on the repair, painting and restoring back the damage to be as good as original! Recommended if you looking for good workmanship with great customer service.

Side note, I had once send my car to C&C (Pandan Garden) repair and the workmanship of C&C can’t even come close to this, I had to do some follow up with C&C to rectified the misalignment and issue from the repair. After gotten my car few weeks back from KGC, so far so good and I’m very pleased with it. The boss DJ is very responsive, he even tried to returned my call during his holiday 😊",en,2 years ago,2022-10-24T00:10:46.812999Z,Kel CH

Many kiosk fill up the compound and from the crosssing bridge, one can smell the aroma of the satays, stir friend noodles, fresh seafood on the grill.  Upon arrival, there will be several hawkers from calling out to you, waving the gigantic menus whilst the eyes scan the place for the available seats.

After 15 mins of circling the entire food centre, we settled into Newtown 51 - pretty much wok cooked, Chinese concept meals. We order char stir friend noodles, crispy omelet dish and turnip wok-cooked, I was refused the sale of plain steamed rice from the place and next door restaurant which was bizarre and moreso a rude, flat out refusal to sell rice because we did not dine with them.

The food, overall was good. tasty, quickly cooked and price is reasonable for the price and the costs of easy dining in SG. The highlight was the drinks which were reasonable.

All in all, I would return again for the buzzing energy of the food stalls and the masses of people they cater to but it would have been more of positive if the locals there were friendlier.

Compared to some other hawker centres around Singapore, it’s definitely more comfortable. While it’s not exactly “high-end,” it does feel a little more curated. The fans keep the space surprisingly cool despite it being open-air, and even the toilets were moderately acceptable — which is always a bonus at these types of places!

The food was delicious overall, though you do see a bit of repetition across the stalls. That said, there are some real gems if you know what to look for. The fishball soup was a standout — fresh, flavourful, and comforting. And one particular stall, which boasts a Michelin star and a few celebrity fans, serves fantastic skewers and chicken wings that are absolutely worth trying.

Definitely a must-visit if you want a lively hawker experience with a bit more breathing room. Great for casual dinners with friends or visitors looking for a taste of local food in a slightly more relaxed setting.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-28T02:49:29.110172Z,Ada K

I Was prescribed 2 types of cream to apply twice a day and after 2 months my pigmentation became quite noticeably lighter. I m so happy.

Previously I went to the renown dr Joyce Lim and she gave me triluma which is hydroquinone, and made my skin red and patchy, and it didn’t work!

I was prepared to do laser to burn off my pigmentation but now I don’t need it anymore.

The receptionist seems to take a long time to figure out their process and payment system.

Dory fish was incredibly overcooked, soggy and bland. The mashed potato was not smooth and didn’t have much taste either.

The butter chicken sauce was decent but the chicken didn’t taste fresh. The rice was very bland - it was supposed to be biryani rice but the seasoning had no taste at all.

Both mains came with garlic bread and a soup, but the soup had too much pepper.

Overall, a very underwhelming experience.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-09T10:22:02.967610Z,eldric lem

It is a small and compact Supermarket compared to their other branches. However, it is very well organised and neat where you can find almost anything you need.

FairPrice always provide better prices as compared to the convenience stores. Morever, parking at this mall is free in the evening where you can slowly enjoy your shopping and even dine at the restaurant after all is done.

There are also multiple self serve cashiers to help speed up the purchase process. The staff are also efficient and polite.

Highly recommended 😊",en,6 years ago,2019-07-04T12:23:31.504878Z,Runner Kao

Andy is extremely responsible and clearly explains what needs to be repair or replaced.

I'm certain if at other workshops, they would have tried to upsell unnecessary services just to make more money. This gives me great peace of mind whenever I send my car for servicing.

The boss lady at the counter informed me that only a 60-min foot massage session is available, and I initially agreed. About 10 minutes into the session, I politely asked if I could split the time into 30 minutes for a foot massage and 30 minutes for a head massage.

Without warning, the boss lady began shouting at me aggressively. She verbally abused and harassed me, even threatening to call the police. Her behavior became so hostile that I feared she might physically assault me. I calmly explained that I had only received 10 minutes of massage and asked for a fair amount to pay. She insisted I pay $35 for just 10 minutes of service and refused to let me leave otherwise.

The staff blocked the exit while she continued to scream. I had no choice but to pay the $35 and quickly leave. Shockingly, one of the staff members even tried to take my picture. This was an absolutely horrifying experience

I was at the same clinic a month ago and the locum attending me to said I likely had nerve compression as I had pain on my shoulder , arms and numbness in my fingers.

I went to the clinic again on 17 April at about 4 plus in the afternoon. The doctor who attended me was a locum, an Indian lady.  I asked politely for a memo and to seek further treatment as the pain and numbness did not improve.  She raised her voice at me , was not compassionate and did not show empathy at all! I was v shocked at her unprofessionalism!

The counter staff probably overheard our conversation and they were more concerned for me than the doctor.

The steak sandwich was very average, topped with lots of crispy curly fries. Meat filling was lacking for $20 price point and the bread was too soggy with oil.
Pasta was disappointing in taste. For a seafood dish, it lacked the umami taste and was overwhelmed by lots of garlic. Covering up the lack of freshness in the seafood...

Coffee was average too. My latte smelled and tasted sour. Not to my liking.

So far, they had never let us down whenever we visited them over any sickness issues. To some Seniors who often faced hearing  difficulties, it was normally due to thick layer of wax and dirt accumulated inside the ears. No hearing aid required, Yim Clinic will probably be able to solve your problems. This was my recent problem solved by Yim Clinic. Now I am extremely clear in my hearing.

Stepping into Level Up in Clarke Quay is like taking a trip back to the best parts of the 80s and 90s, but with a modern, sophisticated twist. This music and arcade bar brilliantly combines retro gaming with an incredible nightlife experience, making it a truly unique venue in Singapore.
The arcade selection is fantastic. From classic fighting games and racing simulators to nostalgic favorites like Metal Slug and Bishi Bashi, there's something to bring out the inner gamer in everyone. The variety of machines, including air hockey and pool tables, ensures that you and your friends will never run out of things to play.
Beyond the games, the live music is a definite highlight. The energy from the live bands is infectious, creating a vibrant and hyped-up atmosphere that perfectly complements the gaming excitement. It's the kind of place where you can challenge a friend to a round of Street Fighter one minute and be singing along to a great cover song the next.
What really sets Level Up apart, however, is the quality of its food and service. I was genuinely impressed by how delicious the food was, it goes far beyond typical bar fare. The menu offers a great selection of dishes that are perfect for sharing. To top it all off, the staff were incredibly attentive and friendly, making sure our night was seamless and enjoyable.
Whether you're looking for a fun night out with friends, a unique date spot, or just a place to unwind with great music and a cold drink, Level Up delivers on all fronts. It’s an all-in-one entertainment hub that provides an excellent experience from start to finish. I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back!",en,a week ago,2025-08-17T03:23:35.013687242Z,Sam Mankotia

After the live band, they suddenly turn up the music and go full on club music which for me is a bit noisy and can't even talk properly which I would certainly prefer the live band style as compared to the latter.

Good arcade games, but it was a bit more on the pricer side. One game can cost you around $2. Drinks and food were also on the pricer side, but it is certainly understandable since it's located in Clarke Quay.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-06T18:47:56.803704Z,Lincoln Lin

•	One of the reception staff (I believe from Bangladesh, unfortunately I didn’t get his name) was quite rude. After long hours of travel and no sleep, guests really appreciate being welcomed with politeness and patience.

•	The blanket had a strong perfume smell, which was unpleasant. I had to ask the staff to change it for me.

'Why would I want to spend 2 hours just sitting on a bus seeing things through a window, unable to stop and take the decent pictures I want, rather than actually being out there exploring the city?' That was my thinking beforehand. But you know what, I was totally wrong. It was great for orientation ourselves around the city, we got to see sections of the city that we otherwise wouldn't have seen at all on foot (like the CBD, or some of the fancy residential neighbourhoods, and the explorations that we made on foot didn't include any of the old colonial buildings that we saw from the bus). In truth, I wish we had done it at the start of our holiday so we could have decided better what we did and didn't want to go back and see in detail.
The bus tour was well organised. We booked online and then went on the morning of the tour to the little shop opposite the Pan Pacific Hotel, where the friendly staff explained how it worked and then came outside and showed us where to wait (under the bridge on the opposite side of the road, so mercifully in the shade from the sun). You get a sticker to attach to your t-shirt as a ticket for the buses and a map that is useful to see where you are. We then did 2 tours, one that's about an hour that went through the city, the other a shorter 45 min tour that focuses on the bay area. As we'd already explored the bGay before, we found the city tour much more interesting.
The buses themselves have honestly seen better days, but they're fine for an hour. Upstairs there's a small section at the front (about 4 rows) that is covered and enclosed, so is air-conditioned. We stayed there as it was so desperately hot and sweaty outside and we couldn't bear the thought of being outside. From downstairs, I can't imagine you'd see much. We were lucky to get on the front row both times, so had a good view, but both buses we were on had a tv screen at the front in the middle of the windscreen, which blocked the view of people behind. The screen was totally unused and so it would be better to remove it.
The commentary over the tanoy system was mildly informative, though certainly not detailed. It was done by male and female voices who were supposedly chatting with each other, but largely sounded very corny. Or sometimes it was just pretty silly: ""How long do you think X Road is? If you said 2.7km, you'd be right""
But still, for someone who knows nothing at all about Singapore, they'll leave knowing something.

It must be said, my initial hesitation about not being able to take very good pictures was correct, even with a top deck  front row seat, so limit your expectations in that respect, but overall it kept 2 adults entertained for 2 hours and 1 4-year old child entertained for roughly the first hour as she tried to follow our route on the map, and we even saw 2 monitor lizards crossing the road by the Botanic Gardens, so that caused some excitement!

Overall, it has it's limitations, but largely changed my view about open top bus tours... so long as you're not on the open top bit of the bus. If I'd had to sit out there, my take on the whole thing would have been very different, very sunburnt and very sweaty!",en,2 months ago,2025-05-31T20:33:44.920053Z,Jim K

There were several companies offering those tours, and we booked this one because it was S$30 compared to the competitor at S$60. It also conveniently started in front of our hotel. The bus offers two routes, one through the city (orange route) and one that goes a bit farther on the island (green route). You can take both routes on one ticket. Both routes start in front of the Pan Pacific Hotel. We started with the orange route at 10:45, which started on time and took about an hour. We were planning to hop over to the other route after finishing the first route at 11:45, but there was no green bus service at 12:00, so we would have had to wait a full hour for the next route - which we then skipped, because we had other things planned for later.
The bus tour itself was disappointing, information was sparse and very hard to hear over the traffic noise. There are some speakers, but you do not get headphones, so it is just very hard to hear. The depth of information was also very shallow, sort of ""This is Little India. I cannot wait to taste the spices!"" ""This is China Town, with lots of little restaurants"". No information was given about the history, age, culture, etc. There were some nice temples along the route, but most of the times, you are standing still in traffic between some tall office buildings. Little India was on our route, but all we saw was a colorful gate hundred yard away behind a crane and some scaffolding; the bus did not go any closer.
If you sit on the top level, the views are decent, but be aware that it is very hot and windy. There was a canopy on the front providing some shade. If you choose the bottom level, the windows are covered with shade-film (little dots) making it nearly impossible to take nice photos. So if you are unable to climb the stairs, be aware that there are no good photo opportunities for you.
The website was also hard to navigate, and although I had downloaded the map and routes, data service at the route was not enough to be able to open the files or the website on my phone. I could follow the route through Google Maps, though.
Overall, we were disappointed with the information provided, and lack of bus service around noon.",en,10 months ago,2024-10-29T04:27:09.340952Z,Elisabeth Bik

We’ve had consistent difficulties collecting our parcels from Gap Hostel’s collection service. Despite visiting during the recommended times (10AM - 6PM) and checking back frequently (like, every hours), the front door is often locked and unattended, with no contact information provided. This has led to our parcels being returned due to limited storage time. Attempts to kindly address the issue with the owner were met with an unapologetic response citing limited manpower.

Surrounded by major streets, the park offers a peaceful contrast to the city’s fast pace.

Positioned in front of the Presidential Residence, the Istana, the park spans 13,000 square metres and serves as the gateway to the Civic District Trail an initiative that highlights Singapore’s historical and cultural heritage.

The main attraction is the 26 metre high Festival Arch, a striking stainless steel and concrete structure set in a reflecting pool. Inspired by the Istana’s gateposts, the arch stands as a symbolic entrance to Orchard Road. The nighttime lighting adds a tranquil and elegant atmosphere to the space.

The addition of the Istana Heritage Gallery in 2017 adds an educational layer to the visit. While the park is relatively small, it is beautifully landscaped and ideal for a short, reflective walk or a quiet break in the city.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-05T16:26:12.693747Z,Abdulkarim ALZarouni

But it is expensive to play. S$2 per try. And the claw never seems to grab anything. It is terribly weak.

But most frustrating is that the tokens are sometimes too big to fit into the token slot and you spend more time forcing the tokens into the machine and suddenly all tokens get accepted and the claw moves. And by then you are already exhausted from forcing the tokens, it leaves a very unpleasant experience.

Go for fun claw the competitor instead. the play experience is much better and at least I can win something. Here you feel like an ultimate loser going away empty-handed.

Wrong strategy. Chases away customers. If you gave me something to win no matter how small, I will have a happy experience to come back and try again. This isn't a happy place to play.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-16T08:28:07.620760Z,Chris Quek

The same evening I went to another cpcm outlet, spent 250 tokens on joyful ball machine there and got 40k tix.
