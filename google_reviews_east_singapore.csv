Ben was knowledgeable and super patient and helpful despite my limited knowledge on the product. His team (another gentleman and a lady) were also super helpful and friendly. Ben was helping to install the Microsoft Office pack and somehow it took a while to complete. Ben had to take his dinner break before the evening crowd began and his colleague stand in to help assist. The lady colleague was also coming over to offer small chat to ensure im not bored by th waiting. The team also brought a stool so i can sit and wait. The cohesive team speaks alot on Ben's leadership. The after-sales service have also been excellent. I had to go back with the laptop to get a few clarification and Ben was again very patient and helpful in testing the functionality to ensure it is working well for me. Fantastic experience with Chellenger at Bedok Mall despite the laptop I purchased was a very basic one under S$800. Some shops may not provide the same level of service for such a price point item.,2025-08-11T04:12:16.661341994Z

Even though they are often understaffed, they are always kind, patient, and professional. They have never been rude to me, and they never doubt me when I report an issue, like when coins do not dispense. If there is any delay in assistance, they always apologise sincerely.

In particular, I want to highlight the cashier lady with spectacles who has been so kind to me since I started visiting about two months ago to destress from work. She patiently taught me how the membership system works and explained how the coin dispensing works.

There is also a very tall male staff member with spectacles who is extremely hardworking — he constantly goes the extra mile without being asked. It’s clear that the staff here work very hard, probably under tough conditions with long hours and modest pay.

Credits price (at time of writing):
$10 = 115 credits
$20 = 260 credits
$50 = 750 credits

Min top up $2 (20 credits)
Card price $1

Maimai price: 8 credits per game
With the $50 promotion, each game is $0.53.
At base price each game is $0.8, a rate that beats even the bulk price of Cow Play Cow Moo Suntec.

Review:
First off, the arcade is relatively quiet and spacious. It appears to have a focus on actual games- maimai and Wangan- rather than the chance games that most arcades have too many of. Because of this, there is a distinct lack of bright lights and irritating background sounds to distract from play. The rhythm game area is lit but not too brightly, while the Wangan area is darker which (in my opinion) is great for focus.

The staff here are really chill, and very helpful. They are generally polite and easy to make payment or request service with.

Even saying all this, I have not mentioned the two main advantages of this arcade: That maimai plays are incredibly cheap (at $0.67 per game), and that the equipment is in incredible condition.

The maimai machines here are very, very new. The buttons feel completely mint (despite I believe  two of the cabs being the previous gen) and I have yet to have any reason to question the hitreg... unlike with some arcades.

Also, this arcade has 4 maimai cabs (with 2 machines each). 2 cabs are the latest gen, while 2 are the previous gen. Because the sets of 2 cabs are far from each other, people only queue for 2 cabs on one side of the arcade, with groups often sticking to one side. This may alleviate queues for smaller groups.

It is a similar story with the Wangan machines. When I last played a few months back the shifters were very clean and tight, and the wheels felt new. This will probably not change soon as despite the number of machines, there are not a lot of Wangan players here. Another advantage for maimai players, arguably.

Lastly, the arcade is in a good location. It is the first shop you see coming down the escalator to the basement, and it is near to a toilet, Sheng Shiong, and Qiji nasi lemak.

As for downsides, the most obvious is the inconvenient location. Kinex is in a rather obscure place, and is a bit irritating to reach by public transport. The mall itself is (in my opinion) uninteresting, though at least the Daiso sells work gloves (but no winter glove) that can be used for maimai.

In addition, the arcade is of course not flawless. During my last session there was an issue with the Funtan card readers, which made all but one card (mine) unable to insert credits. However, since this issue was tackled immediately by the staff, and  also led to a rather fun incident where every single player in the arcade rotated to play a single song on one cabinet, I can forgive it. As for the card system, it is both convenient but also a bit cumbersome (credits take a couple seconds to register and the buttons are hard to understand), but I prefer it overall as it saves the hassle of a huge bag of tokens.

All in all, I don't regret buy 750 credits for 75 plays and I will be coming back. If I can just....find a more convenient bus and the time to travel down.

Oh, and the mall's bicycle rack sucks so. Have fun with that. Hope you like locking only one wheel. I just use the railings.",2025-06-21T05:25:23.533264600Z

Wash basins are provided too for both children and adults alike.

Some greenery in the middle makes the place slightly more refreshing and the open top for the plants to get sunlight.

Great design of a hawker centre so far.

Overall food here is so much better compared to the other hawkers centres near here.",2025-04-25T11:11:18.561865Z

1. She told a Myanmar helper her Thanaka (paste on the face) was ""scaring"" her customers (nobody said or reacted in any way about it) and that to use it only at night, at home.
2. On another instance, she repeatedly hard sell a customer with the pau/siew mai(s) that were left. She added that she would have to purchase the remaining few and consume them if nobody buys it. And, eating at night will cause her to have difficulty sleeping. You could feel that the (obviously irritated) customer bought only because she was pushy about it and told her son to ask the mum(paying customer) to purchase it.

Second, when I first book the appointment it was directed to a mobile number as stated on Google. The doctor then told me to call the clinic at 62844498. His tone of voice used during the call wasn't friendly and sounded frustrated.

Third, I have clearly mentioned that the purpose of the call is for the CareShield life assessment when I made the appointment. I was only told that I need to bring my documents and didn't specify exactly that I needed an approval letter from AIC to do the assessment . When I turned up for the appointment it was then communicated to me on the phone when I'm downstairs, the doctor said that he did not know what he need to assess me for despite saying it is for CareShield Life. He was arrogant and sounded very frustrated.

Our funeral planner passed Dr Kong’’s number and my sister contacted him to come over to the house to verify the death of my father.

I still remembered what Dr Kong is wearing on that night when he came into the room. A pair of black framed spectacles, thick gold necklace, Cartier watch and big contemporary jade ring. Is he going for a party or to a deceased family?

There are a few things which my family and I were very annoyed:
1) The way he handled and examined the body of my deceased father - he removed roughly the tubing still inserted on the deceased.

2) As our father will not be emblemed, we ask a favour from him to remove the urinary catheter to allow us to clean his body. He replied that this is not within his scope of work ( normally done by undertakers ) and if he is going to do so, he will be charging us extra. What sort of doctor is he? How can he be even practitioner when he has such a lousy character and morale ?!

3) Time is like money to him. Rushing all the way to end. $380 under a 15 mins job.

4) No Sincerity.

Our experience with him is really very bad. Probably he only show respects and well mannered to live persons since they are humans while dead ones are just empty shells.

I hope this kind of practitioner will not be listed in the GP list for deceased family. This will create more painful frustrating moments.

The service stood out—attentive and thoughtful. Concerned that we might feel hot sitting outdoors, the staff checked in with us twice to ask if we wanted the fan turned on. Fortunately, the outdoor seating area was cozy and comfortable, shaded by trees and cooled occasionally by a gentle breeze, so the fan wasn’t necessary even at midday.

I was pleasantly surprised by the food. The fish burger came with a fried egg inside, which added a comforting and delicious touch. The fries were perfectly crispy—neither oily nor overly salted, just how I like them. My friend had the chicken chop, which was tender and tasty.

PROS:
1) The location is pretty good. It takes less than 10 minutes to get to Paya Lebar MRT station and the PLQ mall. There are tons of food options around the area, and there’s even a convenience store by the entrance of the hotel.
2) The room we had was pretty spacious. We had lots of space to mobilize easily and open our luggage.

CONS:
1) The service is not very good here. I have multiple experiences to support my argument. FIRST, the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were not greeted at all by the receptionist (we greeted him, and there was no response) who seemed Asian and a bit old, with a frowny, annoying face. The first thing he said was, “All passports (in a rude, commanding intonation).” No good morning, no “how are you doing?”. At first I thought, oh, he must be tired since it was midnight and a graveyard shift. But I realized that this should NOT be an excuse. In the tons of hotels we’ve stayed at in the past, even at midnight, we are always greeted. It’s basic customer service. It wouldn’t hurt to say good morning or SMILE at least. SECOND, we specifically asked for our room to be cleaned and for the bedsheets, towels, etc. to be replaced (we hung the tag on the doorknob). However, when we came back, it was not cleaned at all. Nothing was replaced or changed. We called the front desk afterwards to clean our room. They did not apologize at all for their shortcoming, and all they said was, “okay we will send housekeeping [end of call].” It took about 1.5 hours for them to arrive. However, the housekeeping staff who helped us throughout our stay was the one polite staff in this entire hotel. This staff helped us with our requests, and was very helpful. THIRD, we kinda felt like ghosts throughout our stay. Whenever we entered or exited, the front desk staff just continued gossiping and chatting while staring at their computers, completely ignoring us. When we checked out, they did not thank us for staying with them. Maybe it was a certain batch of staff? Idk.
2) There were some large brown spots of dirt on the bathtub. It looked like it wasn’t cleaned for a while. It was kinda disgusting, as it looked like it could possibly be💩.
3) There were inconsiderate guests shouting and yelling at the hallway at night, making it quite difficult to relax/sleep.

Hmmm, mainly, it seems like Hotel 81 Tristar has a problem with a certain batch of front desk staff. Consider training these guys to at least have some basic customer service skills. This hotel has potential due its pros, but consider solving your cons. Would’ve wanted to stay here again especially due to its location, but the cons made us not want to stay here again.",2025-07-17T12:42:10.178450348Z

Unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory.
As a family of two adults and two small children, we were shocked to find ourselves placed in an extremely small, windowless room that did not match the images or descriptions on the booking site. The photos online were very misleading and felt like false advertising. Given the price we paid—over $1000 AUD—we expected at least a family-suitable room with basic comfort.
We requested an early checkout and refund upon seeing the room, but the receptionist simply told us to contact Booking.com and offered no further help. The lack of assistance or empathy from the hotel staff was deeply disappointing. It felt as though, once they received our payment, they no longer cared about our experience.
We've moved to Holiday Inn hotel for just a slightly higher price, and the difference in quality and service is substantial—larger room, better amenities, and a pool.
We hope Booking.com responds to our refund request, but regardless, we mgacannot recommend this hotel to other families. It was a frustrating and disheartening experience. Until now we haven't heard from the hotel. They just fir the money and not for service.",2025-05-04T01:04:47.892237Z

Service Date: 15 May 2025, 9:30 AM – 16 May 2025, 1.30PM
Mechanics: Ah Xiong & Marcus

Recently send my Honda Freed Hybrid to My Car Garage for its 10,000 km servicing and some suspension upgrades. Here’s a summary of my experience:

Standard 10,000 km servicing using Amsoil products – $138
The team was thorough and efficient, ensuring all routine checks and maintenance were completed.

They also arranged my OBU installation at another location (FOC), saving me the trouble of self-booking.

Suspension upgrade included:
• KYB SR MC absorbers (front and rear)
• Absorber mountings x2
• Absorber bearings x2
• Absorber covers x2
• Wheel alignment
(Special Freed Club price – $1,200)

Additional parts:
• Absorber links x2 (OEM) – $70 each
• Bar bushes x2 (Original) – $45 each
• Lower arms x2 (OEM) – $160 each

Ah Xiong and Marcus handled my car with great professionalism. The parts used were genuine, and the pricing was transparent, especially with the special Freed Club rates.

The suspension work made a noticeable difference in ride comfort and handling. The wheel alignment was spot-on, and the car now feels much more stable on the road.

I’m very satisfied with the service at My Car Garage. The mechanics are knowledgeable, the prices are fair, and the workmanship is top-notch. I highly recommend them, especially for Honda Freed owners looking for honest advice and expert care.

I was having issues with my phone screen protector - it was full of bubbles and really irritating.  I decided to get it replaced, and the guy who had previously installed it for me was happy to help.  He replaced it with a matte screen protector for $24.90, and his workmanship was excellent.  The new screen protector is great, no more thumbprint issues, and it looks fantastic on my phone!

Later, while we were having dinner at Fish & Co., my phone battery started to get low.  Kitty went back to Gadget Mix, and the guy was incredibly helpful. He lent us a portable charger so I could top up my phone.  We were really impressed by the service we received.

We went back to the shop after dinner to try and find a portable charger. The guy patiently explained the different capacities and charging speeds available, but all of his 20,000mAh portable chargers were quite heavy, so we decided not to buy one.

Despite that, we would still highly recommend Gadget Mix. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, and they really go above and beyond to provide great service. We'll definitely be back.",2024-12-10T17:09:44.149049Z

Overall: 4.5/5

Gadget Mix, tucked away along the Punggol Waterway, is a hidden gem for tech enthusiasts like Donkey and me. We've been there a few times now, and the friendly, helpful staff always make us feel welcome.

Donkey was having serious trouble with his phone screen protector – it was full of bubbles and driving him crazy! The guy at Gadget Mix was fantastic, quickly replacing it with a sleek matte screen protector for a very reasonable price. Donkey's phone looks great now, and he's super happy with the new screen protector.

Later, while we were enjoying a delicious dinner at Fish & Co., Donkey's phone battery started to die. Feeling like a tech disaster, I knew I needed to act fast. I remembered that Gadget Mix had helped him out before, so I ran back to see if they could help again. And guess what? They were amazing! They even lent us a portable charger so Donkey could charge up his phone. Talk about going above and beyond!

We went back to Gadget Mix after dinner hoping to find a portable charger of our own, but their 20,000mAh options were a bit heavy for us. Still, they had a great selection and the staff were patient as they explained the different choices.

The combination of friendly staff, great service, and a welcoming atmosphere make Gadget Mix a highly recommended tech shop. We'll definitely be back!",2024-12-11T06:51:51.810162Z

This meant I repeatedly had to request Reception to increase the temperature in my room, so that it was any where near comfortable. However, whilst they would perhaps put the temperature up to 20degrees celsius for a few hours, it would then drop down again to freezing cold. I had 2 terribly uncomfortable, sleepless nights due to this problem! The service staff semmingky just did not understand the problem -- nor did they bpother to check by personally visiting the room to ascertain what the actual temperature was and why this might cause an issue for guests. On the second night, I ended up having to request blankets to be able to sleep -- which is utterly ridiculous considering the outside temperature overnight was about 32 degrees C. The rooms are also incredibly noisy, with people coming and going down the hall, throughout the night, with loud banging doors that are impossible to close quietly (even though they have a sign saying: ""Quiet Hours: 10pm - 6am"", it seems nobody adheres to this).

The dust triggered my allergies, and I had to take medication just to get through the stay. I reported this issue to the front desk, asking them to inform housekeeping, but nothing was done — the room remained in the same filthy condition until the day I checked out. It was a frustrating and disappointing experience.

The staff were completely nonchalant about the situation. There was no sense of urgency or care when I raised my concerns, and it felt like they couldn’t be bothered. Everything about this budget hotel screams, “I don’t care about the welfare of the guests as long as we’re earning money.”

The photos they post online are extremely misleading and purely for publicity. The reality of the hotel is far from what they advertise. The furniture looked old, the room had a musty smell, and overall, the place felt poorly maintained. You definitely won’t get your money’s worth staying here.

Thankfully, we managed to find another hotel that was clean and comfortable, a world apart from this one. If you care about cleanliness, good service, and a decent experience, avoid this place at all costs.",2024-12-23T15:30:15.052550Z

Con: chee ko pek + rude old man cashier at the coffee stall (morning to afternoon). constantly preying on young ladies. When a lady orders from him, he will smile and drool while receiving the order and also look at you from head to toe. After that, he will try to fix a convo by asking, ""Girl, where are you heading next?"" if you take away. If you are a man asking how much the coffee is, he will pretend that he can't hear you, and then if you ask the 2nd time, he will scream the price at you. Standard practice from this chee ko pek. You can straightaway tell it's him from his chee ko voice if you are unfamiliar with this place.

Pro: most of the food stalls sell really good food thats worth trying and you bet, service is good too. long queues from certain stalls speak volumes of their food. The service of the cleaners are fantastic! Cleaning uncle and auntie are always polite with a smile on their face even when their job is tough.

I went for a bowl of fish soup noodles from Chai's Original Sliced Fish Soup stall. The stall owner was super friendly and happy to answer my questions. She also checked with me if I wanted to add evaporated milk to my soup and if I could accept bitter gourd before replacing it with vegetables, which I thought was a nice touch.

What I really appreciated was that the soup tasted great and didn’t leave that thirsty aftertaste, showing the owner’s focus on healthier choices. The food court has quite a variety of stalls, but I naturally went for the sliced fish soup—it’s always my top pick whenever I eat at a food court.

I also had a bowl of mango sago dessert that looked really colourful, but unfortunately, the green sago was quite hard and spoiled the overall taste. It looked promising, but I didn’t find it particularly fantastic.

In the end, I removed the plastic myself and the fruits are not cut. Went back to the counter and asked the aunty to have the fruits cut and aunty gave another classic answer.

$0.10 EXTRA for every fruits cut. Asked for the service charges stating of cutting of fruits which the aunt said it's not stated. Then how can such services be charged when not stated?

Should seek advise with NEA about dirty hands for food handlers and CASE regarding the UNETHICAL ACTIONS by not displaying the costs for services.

From the moment I stepped near the entrance, I had a bad feeling. The place looked filthy and poorly maintained. As soon as I entered the lobby, I was hit with a strong, fishy, unpleasant smell that only got worse upstairs.

The first room they gave me was crawling with cockroaches and ants – literally everywhere. I immediately went to the receptionist and asked for a room change. Shockingly, the second room was even worse. The aircon was broken, the bathroom was disgusting, and the pest problem was just as bad, if not worse. It felt more like a horror movie set than a hotel room.

Honestly, it was a nightmare to stay even for an hour. I cannot believe a hotel like this is allowed to operate in Singapore, a city known for cleanliness. There's clearly zero pest control or hygiene standards here, and yet they have the audacity to charge SGD 90 per night? For what exactly? Roaches and sleepless nights?

This place needs an urgent inspection, pest control, and a serious lesson in basic hospitality. Do yourself a favor and stay far away.",2025-05-03T11:00:51.901090Z

Store Location: Best Bedok Mall

Hi Team

On the National Day holiday, I visited your store in Bedok mall and saw a promotional poster outside stating that Bluetooth earphones were priced at SGD 8, and an air fryer was priced at SGD 28. I found the earphones to be a great deal, so I purchased five units as gifts for my family. I was still considering the air fryer at that time, so I went home without buying it.

Later in the day, I decided to return to the store to purchase the air fryer. However, when I inquired about it, I was told it was priced at the original SGD 78, and the promotional poster had been taken down. I explained clearly that I had seen the promotion in the morning and had even purchased the earphones from the same poster.

During this conversation, one Indian female staff member spoke to me in an extremely rude manner, repeatedly raising her voice and demanding that I show the receipt (which was at home), while refusing to check your sales system for my purchase record. Her tone was disrespectful and condescending, which made the experience very unpleasant.

Eventually, another male staff member came forward to apologise and explained that it was a staff mistake and that the promotion had ended earlier. However, the female staff member in question never apologised and left the scene entirely.

My requests are as follows:

Investigate the incident, including the removal of the promotional poster and the staff’s handling of the situation.

Provide proper service attitude training to the female staff member.

Review your internal promotion information management process to prevent future cases of misleading promotions and inconsistent pricing.

I completely understand that promotions may end or that mistakes may happen, but I cannot accept being spoken to in such an unprofessional and disrespectful manner. Customers come to your store to shop, not to be treated poorly.",2025-08-09T13:15:36.760208007Z

I would also like to commend Ms Esther Chua. Sometime back, we were at Cold Storage, NEX. We noticed that the smoked duck was on special and we love the smoked duck in Cold Storage. We were served by Ms Esther Chua. She is so jolly and cheerful. She took a duck and we saw a bigger one below that one. So like the typical kiasu Singaporean, we asked her if we could have the bigger one instead. We noted that she had already put the smoked duck in the takeaway bag.

I tried the Saba fish, which was uniquely paired with sambal chilli. I was pleasantly surprised by how well our local sambal complemented the grilled Saba—an unexpected but delicious twist. Loved it!

Mixed Vegetable Rice
This is one of the more popular stalls, and it consistently draws long queues. There’s a good variety to choose from, which is always a plus. I ordered the mala pork belly, salted egg chicken, stir-fried shredded melon, and Chinese pork sausage. The total came up to $15.40—definitely the most expensive mixed veg rice I’ve had so far.

And surprisingly, most stalls don't partner with food delivery platforms.

The zi char, rojak, bak chor mee, prawn noodles, satay, western food, Indian Muslim food and economy rice stalls are all good! The drink stall also sells hot pastries that are pretty yummy.

The zi char is tasty and value for money. One regular portion is more than enough for 2 people. Expect a queue during peak hours, however you won't need to wait too long. Our fave is the fish head curry and Mongolian chicken.

The rojak is so delicious, an uncle said he would come all the way from Jurong for it! And I agree, it's the best rojak I've tasted in Singapore so far.

Also recommend to try the homemade longan peach gum cold drink from the drinks stall.

Definitely a must-visit if you're in Sengkang!

Dr Timothy Tan was also able to explain the uses of medication and how to administer them effectively for children. I liked that as compared to the PD clinic nearby, he did not excessively prescribe medication. The cost was also abt 40% cheaper, can be paid with CHAS subsidies and CDA NETS.

This minor hiccup was quickly cleared up, and it was interesting to learn about the shared ownership between the two restaurants.

However, the kitchen's performance presented a mixed bag. Donkey fish and chips were a resounding success a generous portion of perfectly cooked fish complemented by flawlessly crispy chips. On the other hand, my beef steak was a significant disappointment. Ordered medium-rare, it arrived rare and remained undercooked even after being returned to the kitchen for further cooking (see attached photo). While the accompanying mashed potatoes were delicious and served piping hot, the corn and other vegetables were unfortunately undercooked, adding to the overall feeling of inconsistency in the kitchen.

However, I do want to note that the curry chicken can be a bit of a letdown for those who are sensitive to strong chicken smells. so if you're particularly sensitive, you may want to opt for their fried chicken dishes instead.

There were several other items on the buffet clearly free of meat, but when I pointed this out, the staff dismissed them, saying ""those have onion and garlic, so not vegetarian."" Since when did onion and garlic stop being considered vegetarian? That’s cultural insensitivity at best and deliberate misdirection at worst.

On top of that, the coffee machine was not working, and no alternative was offered — quite surprising for a premium lounge.

But the worst part was the attitude of the staff: rude, dismissive, and at moments bordering on racist behavior. There was clear disparity in how different guests were treated, and it left a very unpleasant taste — far worse than the food.

The shower didn't work and the bathroom utensils as described online in the description of the room, such as shower gel etc., were not available. There were two containers on the wall. But both filled with liquid hand wash gel. In addition, the bath towels were used, there was long hair everywhere and a stranger's shoes were in the room. There were no free drinks in the room either. The mattress was like in the 80s with springs. The only thing was that the gentleman at the reception was very friendly.

It took a bit of extra time to locate the property, as the hotel's name differed from what was listed on Tiket.com and the signage was not very clear. Clearer identification would be helpful, especially for first-time guests.

The room and bathroom were clean and generally comfortable. However, throughout the stay, housekeeping service was minimal. Towels were replaced, but the room was not cleaned, and the bed was left unmade, which was a little disappointing.

The reception staff’s demeanor felt rather reserved, and a more welcoming attitude would have improved the overall experience.

On a positive note, the hotel is located in a quiet area, which is suitable for rest and relaxation. It may also be a convenient choice for Muslim travelers due to the surrounding amenities. However, for tourists new to Singapore, the location might be slightly less ideal as it is a bit removed from the city center and major attractions.

A few I tried like their western food (I assumed only one in the hawker), price is cheaper end, like chicken chop rice for $5. Ang Teck lim drink stall - pineapple drink is good. Dessert stall ice soursop soso only but also cheap at $2. Warong Statay selling one of the cheaper mutton statay within the hawker at $0.90 each but sorry to say not to my liking I would say.

So I thought she was telling me that the set was a Medium, well turned out I was charged an additional $4 for it. So in total, it cost $20.80!

I mean, one person nowadays the kopitiam cost this pricing ah. Ok la guess it's because I am at the Airport loh but I would be pleased if the aunt explained to me clearly instead of like smoking me to top up la.

Also added Oyster sauce Veggies for $5

Location: Level 2M Public Area, Terminal 4, Changi Airport
Opening hours: 4:30 AM onward – perfect for early flights or layovers
Vibe: Spacious, clean, not overly crowded, with plenty of local food stalls.

---

🍜 1. Beef Noodle Soup

Tender beef slices, chewy beef balls, tripe, and tendon all swimming in a dark, savory broth that’s packed with herbal depth. The soup is rich but not greasy, and the noodles have a lovely al dente bite.
🔥 A hearty bowl for beef lovers – bold flavor with local character.

---

🌯 2. Singapore-style Popiah (Fresh Spring Roll)

Thin, delicate skin wrapped around a crunchy mix of vegetables, peanuts, tofu, and sweet-savory hoisin-style sauce. Light, fresh, and surprisingly satisfying.
✨ Great as a palate cleanser or light bite.

---

🍜 3. Dry Noodles with Fried Chicken & Sunny-side Egg

Crispy fried chicken, silky yolk from the egg, and springy noodles tossed in dark soy-based sauce. Comfort food with a crunchy punch.
💡 Ideal if you're hungry but short on time.

---

🍛 4. Mixed Rice with 3 Side Dishes

Typical “Economy Rice” pick-your-dishes style. We chose spicy long beans with prawns, fried meat patties, and a runny egg – everything hot and well-seasoned.
✅ Quick, filling, and very local.

---

💰 Prices:

Most dishes range from S$4–8. Great value for airport food.
Cashless payments accepted: NETS, credit cards, GrabPay, WeChatPay.

Rice packs also come in interestingly small bags meant for occasional cooking or product sampling.  Staff are also observed to be jovial towards one another.

I encountered excellent service from a Chinese young staff who was incredibly patient and helpful as i check the oranges. He even allowed us to swap a rotten orange on the spot, which was greatly appreciated.

But upon proceeding to the cashier counter, this manager of the supermarket, approached the Chinese staff and began to scold him for allowing us to swap the rotten orange.

The manager stated that the staff should have open another new box of oranges to see again instead of one to one swap, claiming that they will make losses if we keep swapping.

We believe that:
* Opening each box individually would have been extremely time-consuming and inconvenient for customers. The new box would still have chances to find rotten oranges.
* The manager's loud reprimand of the staff member in front of us was unprofessional and disrespectful to both the staff and the customer.
* The manager's focus on profits over customer satisfaction and employee morale is unacceptable.",2025-01-23T13:37:59.564700Z

Within minutes of sitting on the bed, my children began feeling itchy, suggesting the possible presence of bed bugs.

We found the conditions completely unacceptable and left within 30 minutes of checking in. The photos online are very misleading — in person, the room feels cramped, poorly maintained, and unhygienic. The only surface we felt safe sitting on was our own suitcases.

Called today ( Monday ) at 9am, no one answered and waited on the line... but when the line finally went through, the person said it has fully booked?! Are we supposed to keep calling every Monday just for a slot ( not taking any advanced booking ), and they do not allow me to do a walk in.
