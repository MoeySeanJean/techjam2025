I would have stayed for dinner to but we were having such a great time with the drink menu we lost track of time. I'll be back for that local rabbit 🐇.

Very vegan friendly. Usually not crowded. But pricey.</review>'), (8, 'Classify this review:\\n<review>The Daily Planet is well known for their burgers and cocktails, and for good reason; they are great. The food is top quality, with a menu that rotates, which is refreshing, but they also have a good list of \"classics\" they keep on the regular. If I\\'m going out for drinks and some good eats, this place is my go to. The Duck Confit Poutine is delicious. Very recommend.</review>'), (9, \"Classify this review:\\n<review>I was excited the moment we walked through the door. Then I wasn't. We waited about 7 minutes to get a table, with no friendly welcome from the two waitresses who walked past a few times. Once the hostess, who appeared unhappy, was available she needed to attend to the phone. The energy of the staff matched the dim lights all around, and unfortunately with their soft demeanor the music in the establishment is so loud I could barely hear the host as she told me she would be with us soon. Unfortunately coming off as rude, this set the tone for the evening. Our server was sweet and very awkward, I'm sure with some time she may feel more comfortable with table conversation. We ordered one of everything on the Taco Tuesday Menu. The flavor was great!! Kudos to the chef!! My husband would not agree since his beans and rice arrived without the beans. The tacos were small in size, and the perfect size for a $2 taco. The flavor might pull me back, the service is keeping me at bay.</review>\"), (10, 'Classify this review:\\n<review>Relaxed pub atmosphere. Menu selection is modest but everything is well-prepared.

Went in for my birthday dinner and received nothing less than the best. Lots of options and willingness to make adjustments to dishes which was very helpful as my sister and I have allergies.

Looking forward to going back again soon!</review>'), (12, 'Classify this review:\\n<review>Friendly service. Great Lemonade and Cemita sliders.</review>'), (13, 'Classify this review:\\n<review>The food was ok. Just ok. I had the chicken burger. It was good, but the chicken burgers at Chick-fil-A are better. The beer and spirits were great. The service was very good too. I would come here again for sure.  I will say, getting a table was awkward. The hostess was not friendly and my kids and I kind of just stood there awkwardly.</review>'), (14, \"Classify this review:\\n<review>(I want to give 3.5 stars...) Nostalgia brings me here. Menu and staff have changed over the years, but little else. Decent enough food, creative (soup wasn't hot, but tasty...), perennially awful art on the walls (college town...), fun atmosphere. Dinning room or sit in the bar area. Live, local music. Drink and food specials. Near parking garage, but a little tricky to find for the first time... weird little one-block street. Worth a visit, but keep your expectations realistic.</review>\"), (15, 'Classify this review:\\n<review>Excellent cocktails, very friendly service.

For restaurant week in Burlington, our group of seven decided to experiment a bit and see how the entrées were at daily planet. Unfortunately, they didn\\'t measure up to our hopes. On top of that, our waiter was very off putting. When we unexpectedly had another guest show, we were told \"if any more guests show up we\\'ll have to seat them elsewhere,\" even though it looked like there was enough room for easily two more guests at the table. We also asked for details on their restaurant week special and hopefully to find out about pricing (since it wasn\\'t listed) We were brushed off with a quick \"oh that\\'s a five course meal special for restaurant week,\" as he proceeded to rush off as if it was out of our price range. Other individuals at the table stated that this particular waiter always has had a poor disposition during other visits.\\n\\nI decided to go with black bean sliders and potato sticks. It arrived with two sliders slightly smaller than a baseball, accompanied by a small pile of \"potato sticks\". These amounted to the equivalent of store bought potato sticks deep fried in cold grease and served as a garnish rather than a meal. This meal was $12 dollars before tax.  Leaving the establishment hungry and a bit upset over the server, I\\'m left here leaving this review in hopes of saving you from the poor experience I had. Choose wisely my friends!\\n\\nTL:DR\\nIt\\'s difficult to make me upset, especially around food, but when you add a salty server and poorly attempted micro servings, I tend to get a bad taste in my mouth..

We had been using this location for both of our vehicles for awhile but this time we were told that we needed about $1600 in brake work. (Rust on rotors and a leak elsewhere) Knowing it had just recieved brakes we took it to two of our trusted mechanics from before we moved over 2 hours away and it was confirmed that not only were the brakes fine and rotors just needed a cleaning (for the rust), they also never even dismantled the rotors to view the brake pads. They had sent photos to the state for our failed inspection of the exterior of the rotors and didn't even thoroughly check the brakes but wanted to sell us all new brakes/rotors/etc and wouldn't pass us without doing so. Not only did they lie to us about needed work but they also never did the headlight cleaning that we PAID for in advance in good faith having trusted them for awhile with our vehicles. They stole that money and then in order to get my husband's truck accurately inspected/fixed, we had to cram this extra drive into our work schedule and life as new parents. My husband was exhausted but still had to get back to Burlington to work and fell asleep at the wheel, totalling our other vehicle. He was seriously injured and could've been killed and all because we were led to believe the truck needed unnecessary brake work & we take brake issues seriously as any vehicle owner should. This company doesn't care about the consequences their greed has on hard working families.\\n\\nMy response from this morning's text as well:\\n\\nHi, Mark. The last time we used your shop, we paid for a headlight cleaning that was never done. Instead of doing the requested and pre-paid for service, your shop screwed around with the brakes on the truck and insisted it needed hundreds of dollars in brake work and refused to pass it on inspection. Upon taking it to TWO OTHER locations knowing it had just recieved new breaks prior it was confirmed they only needed a cleaning and the brakes were in immaculate condition.\\n\\nBecause of the lies YOUR mechanics told us we had to cram driving to a trusted mechanic over two hours away in between caring for our one year old daughters and tight work schedule. My husband was so tired after dealing with this and trying to get back in time for work that he fell asleep at the wheel and totalled our other vehicle and was seriously injured and could've been killed. As a result of your business tactics, I almost lost a husband and our children almost lost their father. All because you and your mechanics couldn't be bothered to remove the brake cover to give them a proper cleaning or diagnostic. My father knew the original founder when the first Midas opened in Georgia and he was an honest, compassionate man who I'm sure would be appalled at the kind of service my family received from your location. We have since switched mechanics and will never be working with any Midas location ever again.\\n\\nThank you so much for the awful memories of almost losing my husband this morning and the overtime he had to work after having just survived that accident to recoup the money we lost by paying you for a simple job you guys couldn't be bothered to do you were so busy trying to milk us of more money. If there's anything you can do for us, it's do your job right for future customers so that you don't put a family in a position that could compromise the well being of a family member.

We were not served at the same time, so our daughter had received and finished her meal before my husband or I received ours. The food was mediocre at best.\\nIf this wasn’t enough. Days after this horrible experience my credit card showed that we had been overcharged. I guess our waitress decided that her epic service deserved $10 more than I did and that my meal should cost $8 more than she had stated when she told us about the specials. So I called to report this and was told the manager would call me back. He didn’t. So I called him back and although he was nice I was told that often when this kind of overcharging happens (because apparently it happens often) it’s an honest mistake that is corrected in a few days. In other words, the staff are overcharging and as long as the customer is none the wiser they get to keep the difference. When a customer does notice they “fix” it and say it was a mistake.

I should state first that I use to work here up until a few months ago, but gave notice when I received a full time position elsewhere. Today I was in TJ Maxx with my 9 month old dog to find an outfit for a concert I\\'m going to tonight. As I walked through the store people smiled when they saw my dog, I talked to some of the employees I made friends with while I was there, and I found some things to try on. Two women, who both had dogs, one in a cart, were approaching me and one asked if it was okay for her dog to come to my dog, I said \"of course, he\\'s very friendly and loves other dogs\". Both of their dogs small dogs, and mine 50lbs, he didn\\'t jump or try to lunge at the little dog. Then the dog in the cart starting barking, which then prompted the other little dog to bark, and then my dog started barking. My dog has a louder bark and I realized I needed to defuse the situation so I started to back away with my dog. That\\'s when one of the store managers, Dan, came up to me pointing towards to door saying\" you need to get that dog out of here! He can\\'t be barking in here! Get him out of here you know the rules!\" I was so stunned, I actually didn\\'t know that was a \"rule\" and even so, you don\\'t talk to customers like that, even if I had worked there before. I brought my dog out to the car and rolled all the windows down and went back in to talk to Ted Manning, the store manager. I said I just had an unpleasant experience and explained it all to him and said I put my dog in the car but I just wanted to tell him this and that I\\'m not even going to keep shopping. He then said \"yes Dan just told me what happened. Make sure you don\\'t leave your dog in the car it\\'s hot out.\" Are you kidding me! It\\'s 65 degrees out, windy and I have all the windows down in my car, I don\\'t need you to tell me how to care for my dog, instead you should teach your employees the value of good customer service. Then a customer who I hadn\\'t even seen was walking by and said \"she\\'s right, I saw the whole thing\" I wish I had gone up to her after and thanked her, because at least she was able to see the rude experience I had. Even the two ladies with the small dogs that did the barking apologized to me! I started doubting myself as a dog owner, thinking he\\'s bad for barking, but you know for 1. He\\'s still a puppy, he\\'s going to bark, and 2. The 2 other dogs instigated the situation, yet Dan stormed up to me, arm in the air, demanding I leave. Is it because my dog is bigger? Because none of this makes sense to me. Not only did he prevent me from shopping and finding an outfit for my fun night, but he made me doubt myself as a dog owner.
