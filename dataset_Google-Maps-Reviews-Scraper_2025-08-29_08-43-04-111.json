We understand that the supermarket was closing and they were rushing customers to check out, but we were already at the self-check out trying to scan the Yuu membership and the lady told us \"DON'T WASTE TIME\" and to use the hand held scanner. Her tone and attitude is very uncalled for as we were already in the process of checking out. Couldn't she have phrased it nicely?!? I hear her also shouting out to other customers looking at the shelves otw to the cashier that they are already closed. Is this Cold Storage standard of customer service? Even if they are rushing to close up and head home, is it Cold Storage SOP to shout at customers and to use phrases like \"DON'T WASTE TIME\"?!

  "text": "Visited Tuff Club with two friends on a weekend evening, and unfortunately, this venue falls well short of Singapore's nightlife standards.\n\nEntry & Pricing\nUpon arrival, we were offered two options: $60 standard entry or $80 with bar coupons. We opted for the latter, assuming it would provide better value ‚Äì a decision we quickly regretted. The coupon system felt like a marketing gimmick rather than genuine added value.\n\nAtmosphere & Crowd\nThe venue was surprisingly sparse, with fewer than 30 patrons despite the modest space. Even accounting for the club's compact size, the atmosphere felt lifeless and lacking the energy you'd expect from a proper nightlife venue. The sparse crowd made the evening feel more awkward than intimate.\n\nInterior & Cleanliness\nThe bar area desperately needs renovation ‚Äì the aesthetic can only be described as dated and uninspiring, reminiscent of an old Eastern Bloc establishment. More concerning was the cleanliness standard: our table left black residue on contact, suggesting poor maintenance and hygiene practices. This immediately raised red flags about the venue's upkeep.\n\nFacilities\nThe restroom facilities were particularly disappointing ‚Äì cramped, unclean, and genuinely uncomfortable to use. For a venue charging premium entry prices, basic cleanliness should be non-negotiable.\nRedeeming Features\nThe only highlight was the outdoor terrace area, which provided a brief respite from the indoor environment and served as a decent smoking area.\n\nVerdict\nAfter less than an hour, our group decided to cut our losses and leave. For $80 per person, there are numerous superior venues in Singapore that offer better atmosphere, cleanliness, and overall experience. Tuff Club needs significant improvements in maintenance, crowd management, and basic hygiene standards before it can compete with the city's established nightlife scene.\nWould I return? Definitely not.\nWould I recommend? Only if you're specifically looking for a cautionary tale about Singapore's nightlife scene."

  "text": "My god ‚Äî Tuff Club is easily one of my FAVORITE clubs in Singapore!! This was my first time going and I‚Äôm already planning my return. The music was absolutely on point ‚Äî deep, groovy, and so well-curated. If you're into quality electronic / techno / house music, this place delivers. The vibe is super cool, energetic but not chaotic, and everyone there just gets it.\n\nBonus point: met so many fun people here ‚Äî apparently a lot of folks who didn‚Äôt get into Rabbit Hole (the new viral gay club) end up here, so... yes, the eye candy is real üòÜ but even beyond that, the crowd was fun, respectful, and full of good energy.\n\nAlso, shoutout to the fact that they have an OUTDOOR SMOKING AREA ‚Äî yes!!! You can actually step out, get some air, and still be part of the vibe. It's little things like this that make a night out feel just right.\n\nAll in all ‚Äî music, crowd, atmosphere, energy ‚Äî everything was perfect. I‚Äôm in love with this place. See you again soon, Tuff Club!!!"

Thankfully there were seats available and customers are just there for a short while.\n\nGot myself an oat matcha latte for $6.50 and requested for it to be in a takeaway cup. Service was great and while the matcha taste is relatively light I still enjoyed the cup. The atmosphere was absolutely perfect, time seem to slow down and you take your mind off the outside world. The space is calm, with soft ambient lights and shaded from the harsh weather outside."

  "text": "I had a Suke Quto coffee, grown in Ethiopian highlands: the coffee was elegantly presented in a clear glass flask wrapped with a scarf, with a product description card, a ceramic mug, all on a wooden tray.\nDescribed as Peach and Earl Gray and Citrus, my untrained palate could not quite discern: but it was a pleasant light black coffee: smelt fragrant. Wife had an iced cafe latte, daughter a flat white. All beverages 10/10. We shared a scrambled egg on croissant, (croissant 10/10, scrambled 8/10),  and a triple cheese grilled sourdough sandwich (10/10) served with a nice apple salad (10/10)\n\nThe place is like a three ring circus with lots of things going on. There is the courtyard outdoor area where we were seated (inside was full at 10 am on a Tuesday). It is open during the day and transforms into a beer garden in the evenings, providing a different atmosphere.\n\nThere is the indoor seated aircon area dubbed the coffee bar: A U-shaped bar where baristas prepare coffee, offering a 360-degree view of the brewing process. It also features an all-day menu with baked goods.\n\nThere is the Annex, a retail space where customers can find a range of coffee products, accessories, and equipment. Coffee specialists are available to provide advice and guidance.¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®Then there is the roastery. This area is dedicated to the process of roasting coffee beans, showcasing the journey from bean to cup.¬†What really caught my attention at CSHH was the massive Probat 45G Roaster.\n\nThe Probate G45 Roaster designed to handle a batch capacity of 45 Kg, although the staff told me they prefer to process a maximum of 30 kg of coffee beans at a time. When I was sketching, Aroy was manning the complex computer control. Some of the cafe staff were attracted to my antics and came to take photos.\n\nEducational value 10/10\nEntertainment value 10/10\nAmbiance 10/10\nParking ease (10 am) easy 10/10\nDamage to pocket: ouch, but you get for what you pay. About $20 per pax."

Zenith Automotive is managed by Roy, his wife, his son and daughters. I‚Äôve been repairing my car at zenith for more than 5 years. My whole family too as we are all staying nearby. He was introduced to us by our Cycle&Carriage salesperson Han Ai Lin. At first, he appeared to be very nice and honest. But after a few repairs, I felt that something was off. Everytime we repair a problem, a new problem will arise. At first I thought it was pure coincidence but this not only happened to me all the time, but also my dad‚Äôs, my mum‚Äôs and my sis‚Äôs car. The last I remembered was I repaired my aircon at Zenith, 1-2 days after car collection, my engine starts to make weird sounds. His charges seemed to be reasonable like repair for the aircon $800 but in the end I always have to add on another few thousands. This didn‚Äôt happen once, it happened many times. This time, I went to repair my new car as my husband has met a small accident. He repaired my bumper for few hundred dollars. He said he repaired the headlamp mounting too. After awhile, our headlights starts to turn misty and the headlights was damaged due to the mist. We went back to Cycle & Carriage and they mentioned that it was because Zenith did not repair it properly, he simply use a glue to repair the mounting, resulting the headlights to have mist and damage it. I have asked a few more workshops and they said the same thing. So his style is to charge a reasonable amount and so you have more new problems and go back and pay more money for the repair. I‚Äôve asked a few workshop friends and realised that he is well-known to be dishonest in the industry. Please do not be fooled by them anymore!!!"

We brought the car in and mentioned that there was noise on the front right tyre / suspension and notification on the dashboard that there‚Äôs increase in battery discharge when car is stationary even though our battery was changed only 5 months ago. Zenith told us to change front shock absorber and battery. We paid $1,110 for the change. After taking the car back the noise on the tyre was still not resolved, we brought it in and he said he lubricated it so should be ok. But it was not. We brought the car back for the third time and asked to pay another $480 to change something else. We negotiated the price and still paid. 1 month later, the notification on dashboard for battery discharge came up AGAIN. We brought it back in and asked to pay another $200 and they provided the battery life and diagnostics showing another problem. We paid but no idea whether the problem is actually fixed or not.. When I asked him about the battery life and diagnostics on the first visit when we were advised to change the new battery, they gave me a lecture about mutual trust and did not show it (lol). So both our problems when we first brought the car in were not fixed in first visit and we kept going back to check and top up later. Please be careful when dealing with them because you have no idea whether you are paying for the actual fix or not and they don‚Äôt seem to do their diagnostics well!"

  "text": "I only used this clinic because they were the only ones in my neighbourhood on my corporate insurance panel.  Pretty average standard level of expertise for GPs. The doctors there are friendly enough, although the clinic always looked messy.\n\nI opted to use them for Healthier SG programme, after the lead GP sold me a very nice pitch. that was in Dec 2023.  I was also encouraged to email them, which i did. I sent an email on 2 Jan 2024, which went on to be unanswered for MONTHS.  Follow up emails and even phone calls were unanswered and when I finally managed to get through, it was already 19 July 2023.  All i got from the receptionist Lavina was \"did you?\" when I told her about the email.\n\nSo apparently no one checks the only email account of the clinic but Lavina. Either that, my email is not deemed important enough to open.  In the end, my treatment was kept in status quo and I didnt start my HSG programme till much later.\n\nWhen queried, all i got was a very insincere \"As spoken on the phone on 20 July 2024, we have conveyed our apologies and we are again sorry to hear of the cost concerns with your specialist\", without the lead GP even acknowleging that his team messed up and dropped the ball on me. The fact that my emails and calls were unanswered for more than 7 months was the MAIN ISSUE, which the clinic didnt want to address. I am pretty sure if i hadnt called, it would have gone on to remain unanswered.\n\nI was told in an email on 22 July 2024 that the delay was due to the clinic having to \"clarify a few things with ALPs and AIC as to the drugs eligible under HSG\". It must have been arduous, having to require more than 7 months.\n\nI have since enrolled with another clinic for HSG. They are further away from my home, but at least the Physician there follows up on me regularly.  I feel very cared for by my new Physician, who clearly is invested in my welbeing.  I guess when you put patient's needs before monetary gains, this will happen.\n\nSometimes, it is better to just admit mistakes and not deny making them."

  "text": "I first stumbled upon Italian Coffee Lab through an Instagram video. So on the eve of National Day, my colleagues and I decided to check it out.\n\nThe caf√© is tucked away inside an industrial building, 100 Pasir Panjang, which gives it a bit of a ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù feel. From caf√©, you get a clear view overlooking West Coast Highway, and for those driving, there‚Äôs plenty of parking available at the B1 carpark.\n\nWhen we arrived, the caf√© was packed, clearly a popular spot for the holiday eve. We had to wait quite a while for a table, but the staff‚Äôs hospitality made the wait far more pleasant. The server kindly offered us the comfy sofa seats on Level 2, where we could relax, chat, before our table was available.\n\nI opted for the set lunch menu, which was reasonably priced given the quality. I went for the Modena pizza, a thin crust, light yet flavourful sauce, and toppings that tasted fresh and organic. It was the kind of pizza that doesn‚Äôt try too hard but wins you over with its honest, wholesome flavours.\n\nA spot worth visiting for its friendly service, comforting food, and a good dose of Italian soul. I will probably return another day during less peak hours for brunch?"

Loft on 2nd floor conducive for read/work on weekdays, but closes at 4pm.Moved down to 1st floor , but cleaning staff was already vacuuming and mopping even the first floor when the cafe closes at 5pm. So the whole place effectively closes at 4pm, since there was no way you can relax and continue having your drink."

  "text": "We recently hosted our daughter‚Äôs birthday party at this lovely caf√©, and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Though it was their first time organizing a private event, caf√© owner Gus went above and beyond to make everything run smoothly.\n\nHe thoughtfully suggested that we collect pre-orders for our 60 guests, which really helped his team prepare in advance and serve the food promptly once everyone arrived. He even hired extra staff just for the day to ensure things ran efficiently.\n\nGus was incredibly accommodating‚Äîhe allowed the kids (ages 4 and up) to have their own space at the loft, where we held the balloon sculpting and party games. This gave them plenty of room to have fun with minimal restrictions, which we really appreciated.\n\nThe food received great feedback from our guests, and everything was served in a timely manner. Special thanks to Bob and Junear as well, who helped a lot with coordination before and during the event.\n\nHighly recommended if you're looking for a cozy, welcoming venue for a private event!"

The manager didn‚Äôt apologize, only kept saying ‚Äúdon is hard to make‚Äù and ‚Äúthe earlier ones were all udon‚Äù (which was clearly not true as many rice dishes came out before mine). Only after repeated urging did he ask the kitchen, ‚Äúforty minutes already,‚Äù which triggered an angry shout from the back.

I now understand why so many people have complained. My experience proves that this company does not honour its warranty promises‚Äîstandard or extended. If your phone develops a fault, they will ignore you rather than repair or replace it.\n\nI purchased an extended warranty for my Samsung S24 Ultra in good faith( Excellent condition ). When problems arose, the service I received was unacceptable:\n\nFirst issue: Reported more than a week ago. No response to date.\n\nSecond issue: Reported by email. Company acknowledged it and promised a reply within 48 working hours. That deadline passed long ago‚Äîstill no update.\n\nPreviously, I removed a negative review to give them another chance. That was a mistake. The delays, silence, and lack of responsibility remain exactly the same. I have now been waiting since late July with no progress.\n\nThis is unprofessional, unethical, and a clear disregard for customers‚Äô rights. Their marketing and social media promotions are persuasive, but my experience shows these promises are empty. They have taken my hard-earned money for an extended warranty and delivered nothing in return.\n\nI will be filing formal complaints with the relevant consumer authorities. My advice: do not waste your money here‚Äîespecially on extended warranties. You risk paying for a service they will never deliver."

What you see in the screenshot is what happened this year (August 2025), the driver failed to turn up after we have scheduled a pick up of my old phone on the specified date with the reason being \"Car Broke Down\". The date was arranged almost a month prior. This wasn't a last minute arrangement.\n\nBut this wasn't the first time this occured. In the past (2023), when I also traded-in my old phone for a new phone with Samsung, they also used CompAsia for the trade-in service and CompAsia also failed to show up the 1st time with the reason also being \"Car Broke Down\". We rescheduled to another date then to my shock, they told me they couldn't come again. After I got so mad at them they finally show up on the 3rd reschedule.\n\nSo what you see in the screenshot, is what just happened a few days ago (August 2025). Which means this is the 3rd time they failed to show up with the same reason, \"Car Broke Down\". How bad is the condition of their cars that it keeps breaking down? Everytime CompAsia has to pick up my old phone for trade -in they just couldn't make it. CompAsia doesn't understand that people had to find time and make effort to be at home and wait for them. I took a day off to be home and I'm not being paid for the day I'm not working.\n\nNow they are telling me to reschedule and I have to risk another day of not being paid and them not showing up. They don't do pick-ups on weekends by the way. And they do this to me 3 times. Making the same mistake 3 times just seems intentional.\n\nI don't understand why Samsung is working with them. Samsung definitely needs to know about this especially if I am not the only one experiencing this.\n\nUPDATE : THEY DISAPPOINTED ME THE 4TH TIME\nI've added additional screenshots with numbered sequence so everyone can look at the pictures in order.\n\n1. They said to reschedule to Aug 11th, but I told them I won't be free for at least 2 weeks after they failed to show up on Aug 8th when I was ready to handover the device.\n\n2. They still showed up Aug 11th when I wasn't home. Then tried to blame me for not being home and sent me proof of them being outside my door. But I already told them I won't be home on Aug 11th. They even acknowledged it in email that they are aware I won't be home.\n\nWhat is wrong with them?"

They give stupid excuse on saying high volume of mobile phone transaction when 1300H to 1700H appointment is already planned for a month in advance for pickup of mobile phone for trade in.\nEmail clearly states that \"the rider will contact me directly on the exact time of arrival.\" But they can happily change it to \"assigned rider will contact me upon arrival.\" when i tried to email them.\n\nThey made me waste my whole day to wait for the rider to contact me only after he arrive to pick up at 1650H.\nThey did not own their mistake and change their words to argue back with customers. Deal with them at your own risk."

  "text": "I've stayed at the b88 for 2 weeks somewhere around November '12. Was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the digs and the services that the staff provide. The rooms are clean, well ventilated and the beds and mattresses comfortable. For me, the most important aspect were the toilets and bathrooms - these were always kept spic and span.\nThe staff are all young, locals, mostly studying at colleges, and consequently really know their way around town - they're really helpful and super friendly too. If you ever have a day where you don't have much to do, relax in their common area - its the ultimate way to meet new people and make some awesome friends! All in all, a really good place to stay.\nThis is also one of the very few places in Singapore that i know of that doesn't burn through one's holiday money simply on accommodation costs. Very reasonably priced, it is for the budget conscious (which is, i think 90% of all travelers). Singapore is no longer a rich man's holiday destination. Thank you b88! :)"

His only response he kept saying was along the lines of if you are so smart, complain to Lazada and you are not happy with the service then don‚Äôt come here when he actually did not even take the time to understand the what the issue was. He also instituted a useless step in the SOP where you have to press a button on some pillar before coming to the counter when pressing the button doesn‚Äôt even generate a queue number or result in anything different after pressing the button.\n\nGood luck getting any help or support from this store as they don‚Äôt adopt customer centric values. Will never buy anything from here again."

Was advised to change my tyres which I did. Only to be told when I collect my car that there was a \"miscommunication\" between auto sprint and supplier that I have to come back another day to do my two rear tyres because they received the wrong sizes. And then was told that I need to have a newer model of tyres for my rear tyres versus what was initially quoted else they will have to remove the front ones that were ready fixed. The logic is simply flawed and does not make sense. Moreover, it meant I have to come back another day and waste more time because of the sloppiness. There is no next time and I will be replacing my rear tyres elsewhere and certainly not coming back for any servicing."

Upon rushing back to collect my car and having made payments for the tyre change, when told installation is ready, the OBU screen and processing unit had no lights when I started the car. I reached out and asked if they had tested it before telling me that the car is ready. They insisted that they had tested it. I had not even left Leng Kee carpark when I noticed that. Very appalled that this is the level of testing. When asked to rectify it, I was told all technicians had left for the day, and I have to return another day. I had to foot transport bills to and fro out of my pocket to compensate for their shoddy work. I had asked for compensation in the form of servicing to cover the loss incurred. The best they can do is at most 20% off their servicing through an informal text, not a servicing voucher. My only consolation was a helpful staff Abdil who tried his best to assist and escalate. For others, please watch out for situation like this."

  "text": "This is one of the best massage places with an unbeatable price in SG. During the first visit, I tried the 30 min foot and 30 min shoulder combo A massage. Their skills left me so impressed that I came back a few days later for another massage. On the second visit, I tried the 60 mins non-oil body massage and it was heavenly too.\n\nSince the 2 visits were so close to each other, the lady masseuse even remembered us as the booking name was the same. She even knew that I didn't want the massage too hard/painful so she adjusted the pressure to suit my needs. I would definitely return back to have a massage every month."

The ambience was peaceful and relaxing, which made it easy to unwine. What stood out most was how attentive the therapist was! really listening to my needs and focusing on the areas that needed extra care. I left feeling refreshed, relaxed, and cared for.highly recommended!"

Although the therapists may lack sight, they more than make up for it with their incredible skill, intuition, and ability to identify all my problem areas without me even having to say a word.\n\nI especially love their foot massages ‚Äî truly some of the best I‚Äôve had! What makes the experience even better is the warm, personal touch. They greet you by name when you arrive, remembering the day‚Äôs appointments by memory alone, and check in with you during the massage to make sure everything‚Äôs comfortable. I also appreciate the little gesture of offering warm water after each session."

It‚Äôs a non-oil massage so you can crack on with your day - wandering north to little Indian or south to little Malaysia - without being drenched in oil. Honestly can‚Äôt think of a better way to spend an afternoon than a Michelin stared lunch followed by an absolutely smashing 1 hour massage all for ($10 noodle/ $45 massage) ¬£30!"

The toilet/bathroom is small, but still quite comfortable to shower in. Doesn't feel cramped, even for someone who does feel claustrophobic in small spaces.\n\nDespite being a little out of the way from vivocity and harbourfront, it was super easy to get to by either bus or a short walk. Pathways are decently lit and the road's lights easily illuminate everything else.\n\nStaff were really nice upon check in (sorry I didn't get the staff's name). Really easy and quick check in, no issues whatsoever.\n\nDefinitely would stay again."

My bad experience was the lift was out for maintenance at the time i needed it most with a trolley full of groceries.  Half an hour or more going around to ask help as to how to get to the car park with a trolley of groceries.\nSecurity staff not available at that time 10.30am , a peak hours of shoppers!\nNTUC staff Lee Yun Yuan (ah wes) is helpful n very accommodative ,gave  me some ideas as to where to leave my trolley n go get my vehicle fm the car park! Staff Hertine is the first I approached n she's too very helpful n friendly.\nKuddos to yr staff.\nRegards"

It's ridiculous they want you to bring back the defected items to the same branch you get them from. Sheng Siong doesn't require you to bring any spoilt or rotten fresh food back to process refunds once you submit photos and receipt and that makes more sense! I think ntuc is deliberately making it inconvenient and out of the way so that they can cheat customers."

  "text": "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nIf you‚Äôre around the area, Broadway Food Centre at Sim Lim Square is a super convenient spot to grab a quick and satisfying meal. It‚Äôs your typical food court setup with plenty of choices ‚Äî mixed veg rice, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Malay, you name it. Really handy if you‚Äôre in Sim Lim running errands or just looking for a no-frills meal.\n\nThis time, I tried the Korean cold noodles ‚Äî and honestly, it was super refreshing. The broth was chilled and tangy, with that slight sweetness and a nice kick of spice. Noodles had a good chewy texture, and it came with sliced cucumber and egg. Perfect for a hot day! Wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but it was surprisingly satisfying.\n\nThe food came out quick too, even though the place was quite packed during lunch hour. There‚Äôs always a steady crowd, but seating turnover is fast, and it‚Äôs air-conditioned, which is a big plus.\n\nPrices are decent, portions are generous, and there‚Äôs enough variety to suit different cravings. Definitely a good go-to if you‚Äôre nearby and want something quick, hot (or cold üòÑ), and tasty without breaking the bank."

  "text": "2025 June update:\nThe quality of the sashimi sold here has deteriorated alarmingly. It used to be fine But over the past 2 months or so, something must have changed. Yesterday's 2 trays had a mushy texture and a fishy smell. Something is wrong with the handling or the fish itself. The texture and flavour is just not that of decent (not even saying \"high\") quality sashimi.\n\n2024 July update:\nAfter visiting the Great World City outlet for a several weeks then coming back here again (because of all the NDP road closures around this side on Saturdays), I would say that the quality and quantity of things in this (Millennia Walk) branch is much better than GWC. This is particularly evident in the Sashimi. Come to this outlet to get your stuff, not the other one!\n\nEarlier review when they 1st moved here:\n\nStock levels here seem to be far less predictable than when they were at Liang Court. Perhaps it's due to the smaller space, perhaps due to the COVID semi lockdown. I don't know. My frustration for today: no 1L bottle of Mirin. No Jap daikon (only Malaysia). No kawahagi. Haven't seen restock of other dried fish e.g. aji/fugu mirin boshi. Sashimi counter no longer has the tank for the occasional uni and oysters as they did previously. Koji was out of stock on our last trip but ok today."

It only requires a 30-second sear before slinging it into your gob.\n\nThe pork jowls are also a must-have but it always needs a little seasoning to stand up to the rich flavoured cuts of beef. We even grab the yusheng from them because we trust the freshness.\n\nI would, however, steer clear of any fruits they have on sale. They are on sale for a reason and we learnt it the hard way.\n\nIn any case, our pampered feline used to love her tiny morsels of Maguro and Sake from Meidi-Ya and just for those precious memories alone, I'll admit I'm biased and have a fondness for this supermarket. It's, after all, my furry baby's choice."

We booked a double bed but was upgraded to a queen but the room had no window. The shower was quite cramp but acceptable, toilet had a bidet, and water pressure was good and the water heater is working. They replenish the drinking water and towels everyday. Location is great. There is a nearby convenience store (Cheers), atm, bus stop, gym, and a hawker center(Whampoa food center). Overall great stay, with great service and ok room for the budget."

Rooms are really small, there's no place to even open a suitcase. AC is turned all the time and is really noisy. No intimacy and worse of all is the absence of windows in the room I stayed in. Seems more like a rat cage rather than a guest house. Price was good the night I booked it so it's a plus, wouldn't stay there more than a night if no better option. Stayed at KINN following night and ngl it was wonderful... So good dormitories exist in Singapore for a decent price."

You can tell they genuinely care about their customers and not just trying to rush you in and out.\n\nWhat stood out to me was how patient and professional they were. They took the time to explain everything clearly, answered all my questions, and didn‚Äôt make me feel stupid for not knowing much about cars. It‚Äôs rare to find that kind of service these days.\n\nDefinitely one of the best customer service experiences I‚Äôve had at a garage. Highly recommend them if you‚Äôre looking for a place that treats you right and actually cares."

Each time I register them to see Dr. Seow, you never fail to let me know the estimated waiting time so I can bring them back at the right moment - helping us to avoid long waits in a crowded clinic, which is such a relief with little ones. Your kindness in prioritizing young children truly stand out.\nThank you for always going the extra mile for the little patients and for making our visits to the clinic smoother and a little less stressful."

Despite booking the earliest slot for my medical checkup, I was made to wait for an unreasonably long time. I had been fasting for the checkup, and the delay caused me to develop gastritis from an empty stomach. The irony is astounding‚Äîpeople come here to get better, but this clinic seems to make you feel worse.\n\nThis level of inefficiency is unacceptable, especially when it affects patients‚Äô health. I hope the management takes this issue seriously and hires more staff to handle the volume of patients properly.

While the presentation looked appetizing and the taste was decent, the stall owner could consider reducing the oil, as there was quite a noticeable layer of oil left behind.

There were additions of some round tables at the front, but they hardly added to the seating capacity overall.\n\nA cup of iced milo now costs $3.50, cai fan with 2 meats 1 veg $6.40, and chicken rice set $8 - all a sharp increase from before the renovation with no improvements in taste or dining atmosphere.

  "text": "HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\n**Review of Jap-Kor Stall Experience**\n\nMy recent visit to the Jap-Kor stall left undesired. We ordered a bean paste soup with tofu, only to find that the tofu was sour and spoiled upon tasting. Politely informing the staff and we requested to change our order to kimchi soup, which they agreed to without additional charge, claiming it was the same price.\n\nHowever, what disappointed me was the attitude of the stall attendants. When I questioned the reuse of the same soup for the kimchi soup, one of the ladies seemed indifferent, which was off-putting. Despite my request for a fresh batch of soup, the discussion became unnecessarily prolonged. The presence of the banmian auntie, who was involved in collecting money, added to the awkwardness as she defended the quality of the tofu without addressing our concerns effectively.\n\nThe continuous insistence that the tofu wasn't spoiled, accompanied by attempts to blame the bean paste, did not resolve the issue professionally. Eventually, I decided to end the conversation by asking for the soup to be returned, hinting at leaving a negative review online. This seemed to catch them off guard, resulting in an uncomfortable silence.\n\nOverall, while the food options seemed promising, the customer service and handling of complaints at the Jap-Kor stall were disappointing."

Her skills are **outstanding**‚Äîshe has a deep understanding of pressure points and muscle tension, providing the perfect balance of firmness and relaxation. As a 55-year-old with occasional stiffness, I left feeling **completely rejuvenated**.\n\nMs. Kelly‚Äôs professionalism and attentive approach made the experience even better. She listened carefully to my needs and tailored the session accordingly. The ambiance at Fusion Massage was also clean and soothing, adding to the overall wellness experience.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a **highly skilled massage therapist**, I **highly recommend** Ms. Kelly.

In my experience, she is exceptionally skilled, professional, thoughtful, and courteous. Her demeanour and expertise speak for themselves.\n\nContrary to a small number of negative reviews, which appear to be based on unrealistic or inappropriate expectations, Mandy‚Äôs services are of high quality and entirely professional. It is regrettable that some individuals‚Äîseemingly motivated by disappointment over not receiving unethical or non-standard services‚Äîhave left misleading or unfair reviews. These comments do not reflect the truth of the service provided.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of reviews paint an accurate and positive picture of the standards maintained by Mandy and Fusion Spa. I hope this helps provide a more balanced and fair representation for prospective clients."

  "text": "Fusion Spa Jurong :Unprofessional, Overpriced, and Unacceptable\nMy recent visit to Fusion Spa in Jurong was, without a doubt, the worst massage experience I've ever had. What started as a booked 1-hour Chinese massage quickly turned into a masterclass in miscommunication, aggressive upselling, and deeply unprofessional conduct.\nThe therapist, \"Mandy\" (who was far from the \"overrated\" service I expected), somehow converted my 1-hour session into a 30-minute oil massage ‚Äì even with a translator, I couldn't understand why this change happened. To add insult to injury, that 30-minute session was effectively only 20 minutes of actual massage time.\nHer focus seemed less on therapy and more on money. She relentlessly pushed for \"extra services\" and tips, and when I declined, the quality of the massage noticeably plummeted. The situation became truly alarming when she attempted to pull off my underwear and explicitly solicited an \"extra service\" for an additional $50. I firmly refused this shocking and inappropriate offer, as I was there for a legitimate massage, nothing more.\nThis establishment is overpriced, employs hard-sell tactics, and the level of unprofessionalism is frankly appalling. Save your money and your peace of mind ‚Äì avoid Fusion Spa Jurong.\n\nResponsev to response as u record the nric details it can be easily found out therapist  Mandy time of visit 7 30 pm  Saturday 28 th june"

If without early bird discount, I probably will visit other spa as pricing is not attractive as compared to others.\n\nI had Monica as my therapist.

No need to mention that it doesn‚Äôt taste good at all (restaurant ones are probably better).\n\nWe ordered cake too, that‚Äôs just your usual industrial cake.\n\nThe environment that other reviewers have been raving about? It‚Äôs a view of a semi-permanent and dilapidated construction site."

  "text": "Quite disappointed with the experience here. Out of the three visits I have made, I‚Äôve only managed to dine in once despite checking the opening hours prior to the journey over. Found out that this is due to the staff‚Äôs break time being unaccounted for within the operational hours listed on their establishment (or Google Maps especially for the first visit - attached picture from first visit on a Saturday, 8/6/24 12PM).\n\nMade my way down with a friend to this place for the swing seats and cozy environment, only to be met by an unforeseen closure of an hour. When asked if we could sit and wait inside until then (as the surrounding area doesn‚Äôt have much to do and mosquitoes were flying around), we were turned away as well. I would be understanding if the break was listed like how Korean restaurants choose to take time off in the afternoon, but it‚Äôs absolutely disappointing to be turned away for something that is not accounted for within their operating hours stated. Wound up going to a different place instead.\n\nEdit: did not check Google Maps for third visit, but I did ask staff about operational hours during my second visit + checked iG before third visit in case there were any closures not announced on Maps. I‚Äôm not sure when the break time was added into Google Maps, but don‚Äôt recall it being there during my second visit (earlier this year)."

This place is seriously a haven for anyone who enjoys a good cup of something warm and calming. They‚Äôve got a crazy wide selection of tea leaves from all over, and it‚Äôs not just the basic stuff. Think oolongs, rare white teas, deep earthy pu-erhs, and everything in between.\n\nThe vibe here is super chill ‚Äî kind of like a cozy book caf√© meets a modern tea shop. There are books everywhere, comfy seating, and it‚Äôs quiet enough to read, work, or just zone out with your drink.\n\nWhat I loved most was how helpful the staff were. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to try, but they actually asked what kind of flavors I like and suggested a couple options I ended up loving. They do serve coffee too (which is pretty solid), and have a few snacks and pastries if you‚Äôre hungry, but honestly, the tea is what makes this place shine.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre looking for a relaxed spot to sip and chill ‚Äî or if you‚Äôre just bored of the usual caf√© scene."

I did mentioned that we are already opposite the Redhill MRT station. This expectation was highly unrealistic and did not take into account her age, physical condition, and the fact that she was experiencing vomiting/back pain.\nSuch requests can cause unnecessary stress to elderly patients and may even worsen their condition. I believe clinics should prioritise compassion, patience, and understanding when dealing with vulnerable patients, especially seniors.\nI hope this matter can be reviewed, and that your staff will be reminded to exercise greater empathy and flexibility when handling elderly patients in the future."

I approached the clinic to inquire about an appointment for tomorrow, and unfortunately, I was met with unhelpful and unfriendly service (no greeting no apology) from the staff at the front desk, Shannon.\n\nAs a pregnant individual who made a special trip to the clinic seeking assistance, I expected a basic level of courtesy and support. However, Shannon did not offer a greeting, showed no willingness to accommodate my concerns, and overall made the interaction frustrating and disheartening. This lack of professionalism is especially disappointing given Minmed‚Äôs reputation for accessible and caring healthcare.\n\nIt raises the question of whether it is appropriate to have a part-timer‚Äîwho may not be fully trained in customer service or patient sensitivity‚Äîas the first point of contact in a healthcare setting.\n\nI hope this feedback will be taken seriously and used to improve the experience for others who, like me, rely on your services during vulnerable times."

We appreciated that the sales staff noticed us but gave us some time to settle in and browse comfortably before approaching. This thoughtful approach stood out to us, especially since my wife usually prefers not to be approached too quickly.\n\nWe were interested in a gold bangle, and Olivia assisted us throughout the process with professionalism, politeness, and well-mannered service. She even suggested other designs that paired well with the bangle we were considering.\n\nThanks to Olivia‚Äôs helpful recommendations, we ended up purchasing the gold bangle along with a matching ring she suggested. We‚Äôre extremely happy with her service‚Äîshe was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.\n\nI highly recommend Top Cash Little India‚Äîand particularly Olivia‚Äîto anyone looking for gold jewelry.\n\nThank you for providing us with such a wonderful shopping experience! :)"

However, I believe experiences can be subjective, and in my case, I was fortunate to be attended to by Shwu En, who greeted me warmly with a smile and made the entire process smooth and stress-free. She took care of everything‚Äîfrom registration to making sure I was covered under insurance, all the way through to the consultation and arranging for the ultrasound (which I had to do at a hospital later). I really appreciated how she also went the extra mile to help me book the ultrasound appointment on the spot right after my consult! Kudos to Shwu En."

A strict no and staff replied that you can always consult other clinic that offers you MC extension and here is a simple no. Why can‚Äôt speak to the doctor seen by me, he is a part timer doctor is no fault of me. Other doctor on duty  in the clinic explained that it is unethical for him to issue MC on his behalf. What nonsense! Want money just say so. $45.78 consultation fee during days time is not cheap. Who is so sick to travel more than 12 mrt stations and take a bus ride to your clinic just to get another day MC bearing in mind that one is sickened further by your medication.

Man braucht dann f√ºr alles etwas l√§nger.\n\nAu√üerdem gibt es nur 2 Duschen und 2 Toiletten f√ºr alle, die sich ebenfalls im Gemeinschaftsbereich und der K√ºche befinden, sodass jeder alles vom anderen h√∂rt. Zudem musste man sich bevor man auf die Toilette geht das Toilettenpapier vor der T√ºr portionieren. Das war etwas unangenehm. Sauber ist es aber auf jeden Fall."

No place for your luggage in the room so you need to storage everything you have in the open common area? Makes no sense. They have a lot of beds in 1 room and there is no place for your stuff. Also in the shower no place to put your towel or clothes.\n\nOnly good thing is the mattresses and pilow are very comfortable and there is a curtain. And the location is near the subway and bus.

Later on, I returned to the store to make the purchase, and I was very satisfied with my choice‚Äîthanks to Pin‚Äôs help and suggestions!\n\nI‚Äôve been to several other, even larger, Apple stores before, but I‚Äôve never met a staff member as knowledgeable, attentive, and helpful about Apple products as Pin. I feel truly fortunate to have met him at this branch.\n\nJust last week, I experienced another issue with my phone and made a point to return to the same store. Pin happened to be there again, and as always, he patiently helped me understand the issue so I could try to resolve it before deciding on the next step.\n\nI sincerely hope that all Apple stores will have staff members like Pin‚Äîknowledgeable, warm, and detail-oriented. It would definitely make customers feel more at ease and ensure a long-term, trustworthy, and enjoyable shopping experience!"

Tone of this person was extremely disinterested and unhelpful and he did not even bother to offer to call on my behalf, or to ask me to wait so he can check with someone who has a clue.\n\n100% will avoid this outlet. I called the Changi outlet and they were very helpful and equally puzzled when I told them the Holland outlet told me I had to call them. Afterwards, called the Jem outlet afterwards to confirm if I could bring my device in to trade in there and they were very helpful with confirming as well as answering my scenarios.\n\nAwful service level and a stain on iStudio's reputation as an Apple Premium Partner. If he told me to call the other outlet because he wasn't sure, still OK, instead kept feeding me nonsense about \"this outlet is in town\". LOL"

Then the screen that shows the price was even blocked by so many items, I can't even check my price before paying!\n\nWhat's worse is that when I paid a $50 bill for an $8+ items, the Indian lady go on and say \"Next time cannot do this, we just opened in the morning not enough bills\", but she can proceed to give me the change, where is not enough bills? I told her this was the only cash I have and she ask me to do Paywave next time, which I also told her that I don't have it at that moment. She proceed to repeat saying I can't do this next time. I just told her I'm not coming anymore next time. Hey, what nonsense is this? You need to have so many rules for your purchasing customers? So many rules for generating one simple receipt, now pay money also need so many rules. You sure its your rules or the 7-eleven rules?! Cause clearly when I go to the other outlets I have never faced such audacity of staff implying rules on their own. Hopes the owner do something about this.

  "text": "First of all the room (room 215) is way smaller than in the pictures on agoda. The bathroom is very tight, the shower is in between a wall and the toilet making it very uncomfortable to take a shower, and the shower handle is wobbly making it impossible to adjust the water temperature (there‚Äôs no cold water). Second of all as we were inspecting the bed we noticed black spots on the bedsheets, and the following hour we found a red/black insect on the bed. The day after we noticed that they were many bugs (BED BUGS) and even more black spots (bed bugs remains) meaning that there‚Äôs a untreated infestation. We alerted the staff and they told us that it was the first time that something like this had happened but after further analysis we noticed that they were many complains about bed bugs in the past month (July). I find it very unsanitary that they made us change rooms while maybe transporting the bed bugs with us. We didn‚Äôt even get a refund for the inconvenience even if we did pay about 135$ per night. The hotel definitely needs a complete disinfection, and stricter sanitary rules. If I had the choice I would‚Äôve given this hotel 0 star other than the fact that it‚Äôs well located in Chinatown and next to a mrt station making shopping centres and food easily accessible."

  "text": "I would come back to stay here again. Great location, easy to access via MRT from airport or other main stations. Close to local food spots like chinatown market or maxwell food centre. Able to travel with a big suitcase on foot to MRT. I would recommend the room with window for solo travellers and couples, but if more than 2 people I think you need bigger room. Air con is good, so is insulation form outside. You can hear other people moving around in hallway or room next to you but it isnt too bad. Overall, quiet and friendly place, there is free drinking water and wifi as well. Room was clean and good quality for location!"

The hotel's central location made it easy to explore the city by being near to Outram and Maxwell MRT. Also, the spotless rooms and corridors impressed me with their impeccable cleanliness.

To my surprise, the price included a private bathroom ‚Äî and even room cleaning service, which was unexpected! What impressed me the most was the front desk staff‚Äôs service ‚Äî they were extremely polite and greeted us with a cheerful ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù every day as we left the hotel.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a bar in the hotel, perfect for relaxing after a long day out. Plus, the hotel provides a public drinking water dispenser ‚Äî I really appreciated that!\n\nThe only downside is that it takes about a 10-minute walk to the nearest MRT station. However, for those who take the bus, the bus stop is very close by. The room isn‚Äôt particularly big, but for RM200 a night, I dare you to compare ‚Äî you won‚Äôt easily find another hotel offering a private bathroom and a double bed at this price.\n\nI honestly don‚Äôt understand why some people are complaining. If I hadn‚Äôt stayed here myself, I might have believed those negative reviews ‚Äî and almost missed out on this gem!"

  "text": "This was our second time staying at Butternut, and we didn‚Äôt even consider looking at other hotels because our first stay left such a positive impression. Most of the staff were still as warm, friendly, and welcoming as we remembered, and we truly appreciated that. However, this recent stay felt quite different from our first.\n\nPreviously, we booked the L Room with Queen Bed and Window (12 m¬≤/129 ft¬≤), which felt spacious and comfortable. We had two large suitcases, two small ones, and two personal bags--and we could easily lay both large suitcases open on the floor with slight room to move around. This time, we chose the L Room with Skylight Window, which is also listed as 12 m¬≤/129 ft¬≤ on Agoda. However, the layout felt SIGNIFICANTLY more cramped than expected. I cannot stress SIGNIFICANTLY enough. We could only open one suitcase at a time, and with limited floor space, it was difficult to move around...especially after shopping or with larger luggage. The room appeared more spacious in the photos, but in person, it felt closer in size to an M or even an S room. Although the listed area is the same as our previous room, the difference in usable space was quite noticeable, and honestly, it was our biggest letdown during this stay.\n\nWe also noticed that some of the amenities listed for our room like slippers, a desk, a telephone, and an in-room or laptop safe were not available. My partner kindly asked the front desk for slippers, but we were told they were unavailable. We're not sure if this was a temporary situation or if these items are no longer part of the standard setup.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that there‚Äôs no lift access to the 4th floor. You have to take the stairs. This might be important to consider for guests with heavy or bulky luggage and might get a room at the 4th floor. Also, the air conditioning took quite some time (around two hours) to cool the room, which was a bit surprising given its compact size.\n\nWe do hope the property stays true to what is described and promised in their listing in the future. We were honestly disappointed by the discrepancies, especially after having such a great first stay last 2023. While we did encounter one staff member who seemed a bit unfriendly, we truly appreciate the rest of the team who were consistently kind, accommodating, and approachable throughout our stay. Their warm hospitality is one of the reasons we might still consider staying at Butternut again...along with its convenient location near Maxwell Food Centre, Maxwell MRT, and Chinatown Complex."

  "text": "I got a faulty tail / brake light bulb to be replaced.  I googled and searched an auto workshop near my house instead of going to my regular workshop which is far away. I chanced upon Li Hong and read the reviews. All good reviews.  I must say that the reviews are true. I had a fantastic experience this morning which I must share. I was served by one of the staff (don't know his name but seems an in-charge). He searched the bulb in the workshop and realised that he didn't have the right bulb. He later drove up to the upper floor and came back with the right bulb. I was surprised by the charges he told one nice lady in the office that the replacement cost is $2 (labour, material and the extra mile he provided). I was in awe. Later, I got permission from the lady that I gave a small token (for coffee) to the staff. Highly recommended this workshop for your car servicing. Good service.  Hope that your workshop maintains its good service and good work."

  "text": "Visited Courts Nojima on 3 August to explore buying a dryer. Did not expect it to be the start of many troubles.\n\nWas wrongly advised by sales staff regarding the SG60 discounts ($120 off instead of $60) and use of climate vouchers for a dryer (cannot be used) only at the point of purchase. Decided to proceed with buying the Samsung dryer.\n\nAfter purchase, did not receive any confirmation of notification of delivery of actual date, only a call 10 mins before delivery. Delivery window was 10am to 2pm, and ended up staying home for 3 hours (10am to 1pm) before getting a call that the delivery was coming. Sales staff also was hard to contact regarding delivery (2 to 3h wait, only responded after calling). Understand it was his off day, but Courts should have a staff to cover for him since it still involved deliveries, or have a more contactable number.\n\nSales staff also wrongly scheduled the Samsung delivery agent, so ended up the agent only came 1 day after the dryer was delivered. Asked for a specific time for the agent to come (3pm) to make up for the mistake but ended up with delaying my delivery window (originally 2 to 6pm) to 3 to 7pm. As of 545pm, the agent is still not here. (Edit: Agent ended up being late, and I was forced to take cab to my appointment)\n\nThis is one of my worst sales service to date, from pre to post sales. The only good things about this whole process was the advice given on the right dryer to buy (pre sales) and the free delivery given in an attempt to recover from the mistake in the supposed discount.\n\nPlease work on your service processes and sales recovery. It is alarming how poor the standards are."

  "text": "I initially went to Courts Orchard to check out a few items for my new home. I was assisted by Max, who struck me as a very patient and knowledgeable salesperson. He took the time to answer all my questions over the course of more than two hours and demonstrated extensive knowledge of various electrical appliances. Max also offered helpful tips on how to make the most of my purchases and save money at Courts. He also was very flexible in arranging for the payment terms which best fit my needs. Ultimately, I decided to go ahead with the purchase of a Samsung Smart TV and a Samsung Home Theatre system. Highly recommend speaking to Max if you're going to Courts Orchard, as he made my entire experience smooth and easy."

  "text": "Staff are not very helpful and not knowledgeable about their products and offerings. Even small 7eleven store cashiers are better than these lazy staff.\n\nI bought a camera here that will be used as a gift. No one was around to help, so I went to the cashier area and asked someone to sell the item to me. I specifically asked if the item I will be buying can be returned as I don't want to open the box since it will be a gift I will give on my overseas trip. The guy who helped me said it could be returned after 14 days. I counted my overseas trip days, and if ever there is a defect, I can still return it after my trip.\n\nArmed with this info, I immediately paid for the item. When I double-checked with the cashier about the return policy, much to my surprise, he said the item only has a 1 week return policy. I argued that they falsely provided sales terms and misled me into buying the item. As a compromise, I asked if they could test it instead, though I am hesitant since I want the box sealed when I give my gift - but to add to the incompetence so far, they said they don't have a dedicated salesperson who can test it.\n\nSince they have no solutions for me and we just stared at each other for minutes with no one offering even a simple apology, much less a work around the issue, I just opted to refund the item.\n\nWhen the person who will process my refund came and asked the guy if I would need a refund, the guy even had the gall to tell her I changed my mind. I didn't let it pass since they are the one who changed the terms of sale right there, not me. Stores usually get sued and fined for this kind of misleading sales, but the staff are not even bothered by the mistake and incompetence they just displayed. In any other setup, this kind of attitude leads to suspension or even dismissal, but I guess Courts Orchard management is satisfied with being mediocre and incompetent."

Due to some delays in delivery, I added Eric, who was at the cashier counter at the time, to my contacts. Recently, one of the items required repairs, and I was unsure how to proceed. Remembering Eric, I reached out to him with the hope that he could assist me.\n\nTo my surprise and delight, despite nearly a year passing since our initial interaction, Eric responded promptly and went above and beyond to help me resolve the issue. His professionalism, patience, and dedication ensured that everything was handled smoothly, leaving me deeply impressed and grateful.\n\nEric‚Äôs outstanding service is a testament to Courts‚Äô excellent leadership and management. It is clear that your company values and nurtures talented employees who are committed to customer satisfaction. This experience has reinforced my confidence in Courts as the best choice for quality products and reliable service.\n\nThank you once again for having such an outstanding team member. I truly appreciate Eric‚Äôs help and look forward to continuing my patronage with Courts."

HE was expected to move to her lazy self when he was in so much pain.\n\nSecondly, this place proudly states it‚Äôs a 24h clinic, but when we were here, we saw multiple people being turned away because there was no doctor on shift for about an hour in the middle of the night.\n\nMy partner has said that every doctor he‚Äôs seen here has been fine & helpful, but we experienced EVERY single counter staff member as rude, dismissive, unhelpful and certainly not comforting when you‚Äôre already feeling unwell or in pain. Without exaggeration, some of the worst service I‚Äôve ever seen, and definitely the worst of all in any medical setting."

  "text": "I visited this clinic in the hope of avoiding a trip to the A&E, but the experience turned out to be one of the most appalling I‚Äôve ever encountered in a healthcare setting.\n\nBefore arriving, my husband called ahead to explain that I was in severe pain and to check if the clinic could assist. The receptionist who answered was shockingly rude ‚Äî no greeting, no courtesy, just a blunt ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù That should have been the first red flag, but we held on to hope that once there, we would receive proper medical attention.\n\nWhen we arrived and I informed the same receptionist that I was in intense pain, she didn‚Äôt even look up or acknowledge me with any concern. Instead, she continued chatting with another patient about billing instructions. Only after that did she turn to me ‚Äî not to direct me to the doctor, but to insist on registering my IC and taking down my particulars. This, despite my repeated pleas and visible distress.\n\nI had to reason with her ‚Äî that surely I could be seen by the doctor first and the administrative steps could wait until I was stable. Her lack of urgency and basic empathy was both disturbing and unacceptable.\n\nBut what truly shocked me was the doctor‚Äôs response. After a brief glance, he immediately said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help you, you need to go to A&E.‚Äù There was no attempt to assess, no first-aid measures, no questions ‚Äî just a quick dismissal. And to make matters worse, he criticised me for being agitated due to the pain, telling me I shouldn‚Äôt behave that way. I cannot understand how a medical professional could lack such fundamental compassion and empathy. No help rendered. Continued sitting at his chair.\n\nThis entire experience was deeply traumatic, not just because of the pain I was in, but because of how dehumanising the encounter felt. There was zero empathy, zero professionalism ‚Äî from the receptionist to the doctor.\n\nIf this is how you treat patients in distress, you have no place in the healthcare profession. I strongly advise others to avoid this clinic at all costs. It is simply unacceptable.\n\nThe only saving grace was one young staff who helped to call the ambulance. Thank you for your kind help.\n\nFor the corporate office: this incident occurred on Saturday, 26 July, at approximately 3:00PM. Please investigate accordingly. The staff and doctor on duty should be held accountable."

I understand the need to charge for consultation but for this case it‚Äôs not even a consultation becos ur clinic is not equipped with the equipment for a cyst and yet still charges me.

Drove to the workshop to get it fixed but end up I decided to do my 70k servicing there too.\n\nThere are many workshops around, but their advices and services makes me feel comfortable in handling my car over to them.\n\nThe whole 70k servicing and car wash took about 2hrs but it feels lesser than that.

Initially I was quite reluctant as I am new to the workshop and afraid of being conned. But the staffs and boss gave me a very good impression,confidence and assurance so much so that I proceeded for the repair. A very friendly workshop with no hard selling techniques.

Better service than many 4 star hotels.\n\nI also like that each floor (including the lobby / reception area) has large \"public spaces\" with sofas üõãÔ∏è, chairs and coffee tables to lounge at, chill out and grab a snack. That's quite unusual.\n\nYou do get the feeling that with some investment, this could be a great little boutique hotel in the Bengkong Laut / Golden City area. The other two hotels (Golden Bay and Golden View) are also pretty old, tired and in desperate need of renovation. Golden View Hotel is also MASSIVELY overpriced.\n\nI'd really like to see this hotel be renovated. The area needs more, good, accommodation because there's a lot to see and do in the area - beaches, beach clubs, historic mosque (Masjid Cheng Hoo), many fantastic eateries, watersports, Wake Park, theme parks, carousel üé†, üé° wheel, food and drink stalls, miniature houses open museum, go kart üèéÔ∏è track etc etc etc.\n\nIn Bahasa >\n\nKamarnya sangat tua dan usang. TAPI staf, layanan, dan lokasinya luar biasa. Salut untuk Alif dan Deena. Layanan mereka hangat, ramah, dan profesional. Layanannya lebih baik daripada kebanyakan hotel bintang 4.\n\nSaya juga suka bahwa setiap lantai (termasuk lobi/area resepsionis) memiliki \"ruang publik\" yang luas dengan sofa üõãÔ∏è, kursi, dan meja kopi untuk bersantai, bersantai, dan menikmati camilan. Hal yang cukup unik.\n\nAnda mungkin merasa bahwa dengan sedikit investasi, ini bisa menjadi hotel butik kecil yang bagus di area Bengkong Laut/Golden City. Dua hotel lainnya (Golden Bay dan Golden View) juga cukup tua, usang, dan sangat membutuhkan renovasi. Golden View Hotel juga SANGAT mahal.\n\nSaya sangat ingin melihat hotel ini direnovasi.  Daerah ini butuh lebih banyak akomodasi yang bagus, karena ada banyak hal yang bisa dilihat dan dilakukan di daerah tersebut - pantai, klub pantai, masjid bersejarah (Masjid Cheng Hoo), banyak tempat makan yang fantastis, olahraga air, Wake Park, taman hiburan, komidi putar üé†, bianglala üé°, kios makanan dan minuman, rumah miniatur museum terbuka, lintasan go kart üèéÔ∏è, dll."

  "text": "I was at Giant at Kim keat avenue. The Chinese lady was taking her time and chatting with a customer in mandarin for a long time. Another indian guy came to the cashier, attended to 4 customers quickly and cleared the queue and the Chinese lady didn't seem to bother. I have been living here for the long time and visit Giant. I have to say the older staff here have to remind themselves that they are working and customers facing. Not hosting their friends or family at home. This indian guy definitely deserves to lead the older cashiers. Clearly the older cashiers are too complacent."

I called him then he reluctant to come. took long time to do it. and the machine started printing hundred of receipts. I checked the date it was the previous day receipts. that's mean they never issued receipts to previous hundreds of customers. the manager must be sleeping in their jobs so that his staff behave the same way. after waited for half an hour then he gave me my receipt without the healthy 365 QR codes. when I asked for it. he randomly took from the whole bundle of previous receipts not issued to customers in a crumbled manner and threw at me. he said if I was not happy can complain to manager. when I said I want to see manager, they said not in. I asked for telephone number, they refused to give. he even said want to call police but never and asked me to call police, which I did. the police came and took down particulars and ask me to feed back to the customer service. I will said all your staff has totally no.service quality and need to be retrained and not suitable to deal with front line service. very disappointed that this international outlets dropped to this kind of low standard. I will never and will not recommend any of my friends to visit all outlets under this company. I will also tell them this ridiculous incident.\n\nI insisted that they give me receipt because I wanted to prevent myself being accused of stealing their goods. it is also an offence not to issue receipts to customers let alone hundreds of customers not given receipts. please check with IRAS regulations."

The admin however was awful.\n\nThe first certificate they gave didn‚Äôt contain the vaccine number so they had to redo it.\nThe second set my name was spelled wrong, so they had to redo it. I accidentally signed my husband‚Äôs so half of that was on us.\n\nThe third time, our passport number was written wrong again. All in all 4 redos were very time consuming.\n\nOn top of this, the pen that they used smudged everything around so by the time the booklets were handed to us it was all smudged."

I mentioned I was really pain hard to walk any more, almost beg if I could go in to quickly see doctor and get medicine. When staff A was hesitating, staff B (a woman looked plump, brown skin) said coldly ‚Äúend today, we were no longer accepting new patients‚Äù.\n\nIf it was another institution, I could partially understand but you are clinic.

  "text": "1st August Thursday around 9pm plus, my friend and I went to buy food at 7/11 because we were hungry and we knew alot of shops were closing at this timing. While we were choosing food, I saw that the kimchi cup noodles was on discount 1 for 1 so I encouraged my friend to get one with me even though he already planned to get another food item.. as we paid our food together at the counter, i initially didn't calculate the prices properly but after eating I realised that $14plus for 2 cup noodles (which is supposed to be the price of one $3.20) and one chicken wrap $3.80 and one chicken breast $3.10 does not add up to $14 sth which was what she charged us for.. it was supposed to be $10.10 only.\n\nWhen i went back to tell her and ask her about the price she charged, I realised that all the discount tags that were there were all taken down.. and when I told her I saw it while I was buying she said the discount doesn't exist. Another worker was there and he said that the discounts we saw were expired discounts so it no longer applies. I told them that it's not my fault that they forgot to remove expired discounts and should not have overcharged us for it and not do anything about it but argue back. Now I feel so bad for encouraging my friend to buy the cup noodle when he initially didn't even want to eat it. This lady was so uncooperative and unapologetic so I just left angrily without being compensated whatsoever.\nI hope the 7/11 managers can remind their staff to remove discounts on time and be accountable for their mistakes. As a student who has very limited budget, 7/11 food is already very pricey for me and now with this overcharging I feel very very frustrated and angry about this unpleasant incident."

The pod concept is both futuristic and highly practical, offering a perfect blend of privacy, comfort, and affordability. The space was exceptionally clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully designed with amenities like charging ports, ventilation, and ambient lighting.\n\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, making check-in smooth and providing great local tips. The location was very convenient‚Äîclose to MRT stations, food spots, and popular attractions. Whether you're a solo traveler, digital nomad, or just looking for a unique stay, Spacepod is a fantastic choice.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore and looking for an affordable yet high-quality accommodation option!"

But Mincent Car Workshop has already won me over with my previous visits.\n\nAlthough the team is pretty new, and the mechanics are young. Their expertise is far beyond their age. Ah Kuan has a very high standard of work, and is able to find the root cause of issues very easily. When an engine rebuild is done, he does a stand-by bed standard of placing parts so that nothing is missed out. The other 2 mechanics are also attentive to details, and will clarify any issues you report.\n\nBeing my 4th visit so far, they have saved me quite alot of money by finding out the actual real root cause, instead of just making you replace everything like some workshops do....\n\nSolutions provided are well thought out and they are linked up with the Malaysia branches so parts can be easily sourced even for old cars. Reasonable pricing, service is unrivalled\n\nDo give them a try!"

  "text": "My car Malfunction Warning Indicator Light started blinking on Valentine's Day, Wednesday, (5th Day of the Lunar New Year). Did some research on the internet and found some workshops with positive reviews. However, Mincent Car Workshop Singapore was the only workshop with 5 Stars rating and all positive reviews. Tried calling them and other's positive reviews workshop on Thursday, however they were closed. Finally contacted Mincent on Friday and spoke with the boss's Junyang that I will dropped by his workshop in the afternoon after 2pm. My car was vibrating violently both when idling and driving, checked my car's manual and it could be my Electronic Control Unit (ECU) issues. Asked him if my car should be tow to his workshop or I am still able to drive there. He advised driving slowly to the workshop and if there are any problems, I can contact him immediately. Managed to reached his workshop at about 3.30pm. As it is still CNY's holidays, his workshop has only 1 mechanic, otherwise he would have 3 to 4 mechanics. His partner in business spoke to me when I arrived there, and directly me to Junyang. Both him and his partner are customer's oriented persons and very sociable. They will interact with customers and explain clearly the problems with their cars and what needed to be done and the cost of the repairs before proceeding with the repairs. They price is very reasonable. As they do not store a lot of spare parts in their small workshop, they have to ordered from their regular suppliers. Despite that, they are able to diagnosed my car's problems within 30 minutes (4pm). Luckily the problems were my spark plugs and ignition coils, and not my ECU. I agreed on the cost of the repairs and I drove my car home at 5 plus, despite there were many customers at his workshop. His mechanic is very skilled, knowledgeable and friendly as well. Thank you Junyang and his team at Mincent! I will return there if I need to do regular maintenances and other car services in the future! I will definitely recommend Mincent to my friends and colleagues!"

They also offer a kids‚Äô menu, which includes a main and drink ‚Äì a thoughtful touch for families.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food was decent, the service left much to be desired. It appeared that only one service staff was managing the floor, which resulted in a long wait for drinks and multiple reminders needed for cutlery, condiments, and basic requests.\n\nOverall, the experience was underwhelming, and while the location is great for families, we‚Äôre unlikely to return given the slow service."

It is very well ventilated with a few of those long bladed low velocity high volume fans. Next the food‚Ä¶ the fish ball noodle shop is open 24hrs ‚Ä¶ it is excellent. Noodles are al dente and the fish balls are nice. The lor mee is similarly excellent. Can‚Äôt say the same about the prawn noodle shop though. It sells prawn noodles, pork rib noodles, wonton noodles, and some combination of chicken and charsiew rice. The noodles are pedestrian and the meats are not very good. The pork rib noodle is tasty but that‚Äôs the noodle. The meat itself is not very tasty and not very soft. Ditto the charsiew. Also very strange for pork rib noodles to be served on a plate. It‚Äôs just weird. I‚Äôd avoid this stall like the plague the next time. I see a very enticing fish porridge soup. Oh and I like the soya bean stall. There are others but not all are open even on a Saturday (or because it is a Saturday‚Ä¶ been 3 Saturdays). If visiting, please avoid parking there for Saturday lunch. It took us over 30 mins to get out of the carpark ‚Ä¶ perhaps because the people going to ICA are parking here and it‚Äôs a really bad layout. It felt like waiting in a JB jam. If I crawled, I would have left the carpark in 10 minutes."

It has several stalls ‚Äî Thai, Mala, Mixed Vegetable Rice, Ban Mian/Fish Soup, and Indian (Vegetarian).\n\nFor the Thai food:\n1. The green curry chicken is good, but quite spicy. The chicken slices are quite plenty.\n2. The pandan chicken is also good -- it is well-marinated and juicy.\n\nFor the Ban Mian/Fish soup stall:\n1. The double fish soup is good. You can opt for milk to be put in as well. 2. The dumplings are also good. It is filled with a mixture of chives and pork and is juicy.\n3. The tomato egg noodle is good too. It is like ban mian, except that the soup base is sweet and slightly tangy.\n\nFor the La Mian/Hotplate stall, they have beef noodle. The beef slices are tender, but maybe, the spicy option would be better, as the non-spicy option made the soup tasted salty.\n\nFor the Waffles stall, they have the waffle with ice cream. The waffle itself is crispy. The ice cream flavors are also quite good -- I particularly liked the cookies and cream and the mango."

As expected a wide variety of drink options, includes low and non-alcoholic so everyone has an option\n\n2024-03 at night the fan means the overhead lights are flashing on some tables..can be distracting for some, just depends on table.\n\nConsistently large portions of tasty food.\n\n2021-05: Simple takeaway brunch of Beef Goulash, Fladen and though it's small I would always recommend the camenbert with cranberry mouse - amazing taste combination."

The rice had a rotten taste (maybe weather too humid, rice spoil very fast), the rice was also cold and hard. The duck meat was too tough. Overall, i regretted getting this.

Sausages were okay, if a little salty and not really having enough bite. Mash was way too runny. Sauerkraut out of a jar. Honestly, for a repast that's available this late at night I can't fault them overly much for the TV-dinner quality of food on hand."

  "text": "I chose Baden Restaurant & Pub to celebrate my birthday, expecting a wonderful experience based on its reputation. Unfortunately, the evening turned out to be deeply disappointing due to the unprofessional handling of an uncomfortable situation.\n\nThe evening started well, with swift service and a pleasant outdoor setup. However, the experience took a turn when a guest seated beside us, who appeared intoxicated, took my steak knife and began touching my food. Shocked, I brought this to the attention of the waiter, expecting it to be resolved appropriately. Instead, I was met with dismissiveness and unprofessional behavior.\n\nThe waiter told me, ‚ÄúCome on lah, bro, this is my regular customer, I‚Äôll take care of it,‚Äù while patting me on the shoulder. When I politely asked him not to touch me, his behavior escalated as he yelled at me in Malay, using inappropriate language. Despite informing the manager, no meaningful resolution was offered. The manager insisted that I stay, despite my clear discomfort, and ignored my request to settle the bill promptly.\n\nEventually, I left the restaurant without tasting any of the food I had ordered. This experience not only ruined my birthday celebration but left me feeling disrespected as a customer.\n\nI hope the management addresses these issues seriously to ensure other patrons do not endure similar treatment."

Probably only worth 2 shots or less in that glass. You'll probably find more value for money for options down the HV streets.  Very competitive landscape, sad to see Baden has decreased in quality and competitiveness since I first visited more than half a decade ago."

Although the place can house hundreds of people, noise level is still reasonable for families and friends to have good conversations because of the high ceiling and the spaciousness of the place. In terms of food, it is excellent due to its variety, quality and affordability. You have a cai peng stall with lots of food dishes and a Michelin star zhi char stall with good customer service. You can order a set meal of 3 claypot dishes with delicious tastes. There are many, many other good stalls. Overall, you can get good amount of food quantity for the price that you paid.

  "text": "‚≠ê 1 Star (if I could give 0, I would)\n\nI‚Äôve been servicing my car with Quicklane for over 9 years because they always push me into buying their servicing packages ‚Äî which ties me down to them. In the early years, before they onboarded BYD, their servicing standards were excellent and I was genuinely happy, which is why I kept buying their packages. But even with a package, I always seemed to incur extra charges here and there.\n\nSince they started handling BYD, everything has gone downhill. The CSAs don‚Äôt bother replying to messages, and when they finally do, the service attitude is shockingly poor.\n\nMy most recent experience was the last straw:\n‚Ä¢\tAfter sending my car in for servicing, I had to tow it off the highway just 2 days later.\n‚Ä¢\tWhen they couldn‚Äôt identify the issue, their ‚Äúsolution‚Äù was simply to replace parts at my cost. Convenient, isn‚Äôt it?\n‚Ä¢\tMy Bluetooth system issue has dragged on forever ‚Äî their answer? Replace the entire radio system! What nonsense.\n‚Ä¢\tWithin the SAME month of servicing, my engine light came on. When I asked why this happened right after servicing, they had no proper explanation and instead told me to come down for a diagnostic test ‚Äî and pay another $70 for it.\n\nBefore sending the car in, I never had these issues. Now I‚Äôm left with even more problems, extra bills, and no accountability from them."

In this stressful situation, I contacted Mr. Nasir, who responded promptly and patiently .He expertly guided me through identifying potential causes of the breakdown, demonstrating remarkable knowledge and professionalism. His calm and reassuring approach immediately gave me peace of mind.\n\nMy vehicle was towed to the Quick Lane workshop at Alexandra, where Mr. Nasir continued to provide outstanding support. He kept me informed throughout the diagnostic process and promptly explained the issue of my car failure was due to the gear lever cable assembly had failed, preventing the engine from starting.\n\nDespite the workshop being exceptionally busy with numerous maintenance services , Mr. Nasir coordinate very well with his technical team and repaired my car efficiently, replacing the new gear lever cable assembly and my car was tested ok . He also proactively followed up on my car scheduled routine service, ensuring I was reminded and well-informed.\n\nMr. Nasir‚Äôs expertise, dedication, and customer-centric attitude truly exceeded my expectations. I am thoroughly delighted with his excellent service.\n\nI believed Mr. Nasir for his excellence , he embodies the highest standards of Quick Lane commitment to customer care.\n\nMr. Nasir , I thank you for fostering such a professional and reliable service environment .

There are variety of food but sadly one Indian shops selling Thosai and Prata and other Indian dishes inside Bendeermeer mall. Also saw only one Malay stall at the hawker centre. The food prizes seem to vary widely more like preicey for a hawker centre. Do not be fooled by the low price as the helpings are small"

However when we received our bills, we were shocked that we were charged $88*3 with GST ++. We went on to clarify but the person who served us was rather aggressive in justifying. Therefore, Please check your bills before proceeding the payment. I will never come back to such places with such unethical sales tactic. FYI, we left the place very sober."

The exhibits are not simply books on the history of the time, but also include photographs, the war situation in each country, and life-size wax figures of wartime meetings. The entire exhibit is packed with information, so we recommend taking your time to explore(at least 2H). It's easy to climb the mountain toward the fort to see the exhibits, and then walk along the Siloso Skywalk on your way back."

This hawker centre is sort of divided - that said, unevenly into two, with the smaller section nearer to the Beauty World MRT Station exit.

  "text": "The Bukit Timah Temporary Market, set up in October 2024 to house displaced hawkers from the original Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre, continues to deliver on what matters most: food that‚Äôs rooted in tradition and flavor.\n\nDuring a recent visit, the highlight was a plate of Hokkien Mee, which retained the wok hei aroma and balanced seafood richness that fans of the original centre would recognize. The noodles were well-braised, with a generous mix of prawns and squid, and came with a sambal that was both smoky and sharp. Despite the change in location, the quality and character of the dish remain impressively intact.\n\nFor dessert, the Ice Kachang offered a refreshing counterpoint. It came tall and finely shaved, with a classic mix of red beans, attap seeds, jelly, and sweet corn, topped with syrup that didn‚Äôt overwhelm. The texture and taste were reminiscent of hawker desserts from an earlier era ‚Äî unpretentious and satisfying.\n\nWhile the market can feel stuffy, especially during lunchtime, this is an understandable trade-off given its temporary structure and heavy foot traffic. Ventilation fans are in place, but visitors might prefer to come earlier in the day or later in the afternoon for a more comfortable experience.\n\nDespite the spatial limitations, the market maintains a familiar charm. Seating is reasonably ample, the place is kept clean, and stallholders continue to serve food with the same energy and pride as before. For those who frequented the old Bukit Timah Market, the new setup offers continuity ‚Äî not just in taste, but in spirit.\n\nFor anyone looking to revisit old favourites or explore enduring hawker craft, the Jalan Seh Chuan site is well worth the trip."

The views from the bridge are lovely, especially in the evening when it‚Äôs illuminated with colorful LED lights.\n\nWhile the area can get a bit warm during the day, the cool breeze and shaded sections along the trail make the walk enjoyable. It‚Äôs also relatively quiet, offering a peaceful escape from the city‚Äôs hustle and bustle.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre hiking the Southern Ridges or just exploring Singapore‚Äôs green spaces, Alexandra Arch is a must-visit spot. A great place to enjoy nature and snap some Instagram-worthy photos!"

The ridiculous reason given by the rude Indian manager was because I did not purchase another drink after I had finished my first drink. How could he expect me to immediately buy another drink after I had just finished my first drink? His logic was that if I don't buy another drink, I had to leave the club immediately. Out of all the bars/clubs I have been to, this is the only one with the absurd policy whereby customers are expected to immediately purchase more drinks after consuming their previous drinks. The Indian manager had poor customer service and is a horrible jerk. Avoid this place!"

The issue was fixed on the same day and at a super super affordable price. While waiting for my car to be fixed, the lady boss also offered some coffee and snacks which was a nice touch.\n\nEveryone at the workshop was helpful, communicative and reassuring which is very important to a first time car buyer like me.\n\nA workshop and mechanic with integrity is a very rare find these days, and I‚Äôm glad I went here today. Will be a returning customer for sure. :)"

If those djs are being paid to play that nonsense, please hire me instead. Also unsure as to why the club is trying to be 'hidden' and why there's so much security. Is it because the djs are so awful that people might attempt to show their displeasure at them? Music 0/10 Crowd 3/10 (No one was dancing because the music was so bad) Drinks 5/10"

On top of that, having access to coffee and tea 24/7 was a thoughtful touch that I really appreciated. And the location is also in walking distance to MRT and Bus stop.\n\nEverything was clean, comfortable, and well-organized.

  "text": "I stayed 5 nights at this hostel, which uses capsule-style beds for sleeping. Overall, the experience was very pleasant, although there are a few aspects to consider.\n\nROOM:\nThe capsules do not have doors, so much like in a typical hostel, you can hear everything happening around you. Additionally, the capsule structure is quite noisy; any movement causes creaking sounds that could disturb your roommates.\n\nThat said, the setup was otherwise great. Each capsule includes a power outlet, RGB lighting, a fan system, and the room has air conditioning.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe service was excellent.\nThe staff were friendly and quick to respond to requests. We asked for an extra blanket and a fresh towel, and both were provided promptly.\n\nBreakfast is included, though it‚Äôs simple: toasted bread with butter, chocolate spread, or peanut butter. Tea and coffee are available 24/7, which is a nice touch.\n\nLOCATION:\nThe location is ideal for exploring the city. The metro station is just a 5-minute walk away, and both Little India and Chinatown can be reached on foot within a short time."

If I wasnt there to meet someone, I would have left.\nThe seatings are even more ridiculous. Potentially you could end up seated on a stool, no backing, or arm rest with the rest of the group in plush arm chairs.\nDisappointed after the renovation. If not for the branding, I doubt anyone would want to go such a place. Lots of better welcoming bars out there ."

  "text": "Location is excellent. 1 to 2 mins walk to a 24 hours 7 eleven, Burger King and Mac Donalds and many restaurants. Short walk to Boat Quay & Clark Quay, China Town & Centre Business District.Checked in on a Sunday evening. It was very quiet. Staff informed me that the pub upstairs doesn't operate on Sundays. This Capsule/Pod Hostel is newly opened wef Jan 2024. Hence, the aircons are very powerful, extremely clean and comfortable beddings, clean bathrooms. Except you need to go out of the main entrance to use the toilets and hv to key in a separate set password to enter the toilets. There is a big fridge next to the entrance for guests to use. Free coffee, tea, milo and water at the pantry.  Area is safe, although there is a pub upstairs. ADD ON Ôºö Extended my stay for another 2 nights, and realised that once after 12 midnight there is less noise from pub as live band stops. You can hear fade music at Room B ( the 16 female pods) but I solved it by listening to music on my earpiece and I usually sleep at 1 am hence it doesnt affect me as much. I think it will be quieter at Room A ( mixed pods) as it is further away. I paid around $38 per night and stayed at a corner lower deck pod. It is definitely value for money if you are looking at a clean capsule hotel at a good location. Honestly, throughout the 3 nights, I slept well, there wasn't any noise from the other pods as this place is relatively new hence it is not fully occupied thus not many people walking in and out."

It was certainly not worth staying... (I paid about S$70+ per night for it)\n\nThe private room is no different from sleeping in a store room with no windows. The lack of a single light from outside is the same as living in a black hole. Air ventilation is close to none, I had a hard time breathing to which, sleeping in bunk bed would be better.\n\nThe worst thing? You can find the room trembling to the loud music from the nightclub above which I remember was way after 1am... Entry into the private room operates by downloading an\n\nThey only provide in house showers rooms which are small and lacks space & hook for your clothes + essentials. The building‚Äôs toilet outside of the hostel feels super hot located just beside the air duct vacuuming heat from kitchens below.\n\nThe large coworking table & local beverage is great.

  "text": "My recent stay here booked through Agoda was a series of unacceptable shortcomings. Upon arrival at midnight, the complete lack of signage for the establishment made finding it an exasperating experience.  Exhausted from travel, I finally located the place with the assistance of a helpful stranger ‚Äì on the top floor of a building where even other tenants seemed unaware of its existence.\n\nThe frustration continued at the check-in.  There was no staffed front desk, and the information provided by the staff regarding check-in details was incomplete and ultimately unusable. Two other guests faced similar issues, struggling with incorrect access codes. Thankfully, another guest  assisted us in deciphering the unclear instructions, a process that consumed a frustrating thirty minutes.  Despite repeated attempts to reach staff through the Agoda app, no assistance was provided.\n\nThe deficiencies continued within the capsule room itself. The extreme lack of ventilation and absence of at least a small fan inside the capsule made for an uncomfortably hot environment. Even with the curtain partially open for a semblance of air circulation, the temperature remained stifling.  As if the physical discomfort wasn't enough, the night was plagued by excessive noise. Loud karaoke music from a nearby bar echoed through the walls throughout the early hours, hindering sleep. Furthermore, the capsule design offered minimal soundproofing, allowing even minor noises from other guests to easily disrupt the tranquility of the room.\n\nThe final indignity came in the form of the shared bathroom. Located outside the hotel itself, it was a dirty and inconvenient communal facility.  This unsanitary situation was the final straw.  The next morning, I promptly checked out, deeply dissatisfied with the entire experience.  This stay fell far short of even the most basic hospitality standards. If you prioritize comfort and a well-maintained environment, I strongly recommend avoiding this accommodation entirely."

  "text": "This hostel was unfortunately a letdown. The check-in process was a headache, with gaps in the instructions. Despite reaching out to customer service for help, I still ended up having to figure it out mostly on my own and it took way too long. Self-check-in isn't a new concept, but the way it's handled here is disjointed and leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nFinding the place is next to impossible, and the instructions didn't give the actual location. Like others, I had to rely on reviews to track it down. (PS: If you're struggling to find the entrance, look for a lift inside an unmarked entrance at the back of an alley at a different address ‚Äî it's at number 13, not 11...)\n\nOnce inside, the cleanliness wasn't up to par and trash was scattered around. There's a loud club in the same building that shakes the floor all night. At that point, I decided to cut my losses and found another place to stay.\n\nI appreciated that the staff responded to my concerns by email and we had a polite dialogue, but they refused to provide a refund for future nights I wasn't going to stay. It would have been nice to see more flexibility given the circumstances.\n\nOverall, the experience here wasn't good, and they were content to keep my money despite providing a poor experience. I'd explore other options in the area next time.\n\nEdit: in their public response to my review, the hostel claimed they would be reaching out to me directly to address a concern. I never heard from them."

Very near the MRT station that has 2 intersecting lines.\n\nBed itself was extremely clean, and room was spacious even though it's a bunk bed.\n\nThe room was vacuumed daily too.\n\nThe only challenge was the noise and bathroom.\nThere were only 3 showers and toilets was outside the hotel's main door.\nSince area is full of bars, the noise at night lasts until 2 am.\n\nOther than that, check in and out are a breeze. Definitely recommend this place."

Service is OK and your drink comes out pretty fast. Coffee shops close early on the Orchard strip so this place is the best option for a late night drink since they close late."

However, the service was slow and not top notch.  Damn Good Coffee is a good drink, but when they lifted the lid of the Smoky Negroni, there was no smoke. So it was a Negroni.   Food was presented well, but not very good.  Would definitely not recommend the duck croquettes. The prawns were adequate.\nThe big downside is that there is nothing special about the atmosphere and hotel guests transit through on way to pool, restaurant, and other places. So hard to enjoy drinks when a couple kids come shrieking through.\nOverall, I would not recommend this bar.  Definitely only for those staying at the hotel and even then, not sure I would get drinks there."

I'm only giving this grade because the dolphin trainers were well-organized and made sure that the participants were aware of the safety regulations.\n\nWe were willing to pay the price for the dolphin experience because we know it costs money to upkeep the place, give dolphins good food (I see they are always feeding them well) etc.\n\nBUT the overall experience was not good. The toilets are not in the best condition. As an observer, I was bitten ferociously by mosquitoes while waiting for my family to finish their experience with the dolphins. And the worst thing is, they did not provide any towels when the participants got out of the water. It was cold and we still had to listen to the debrief... and wait, listen to their sales pitch for the photographs.\n\nThe photographs are such a rip-off, but guess what - we end up having to buy it because the staff are extremely strict about not bringing in your own cameras or phones. 2 photos that cost close to $170. It was the cheapest deal that we could find. The quality of the photos aren't even that great and the photo frame is flimsy. This left a a sour taste in my mouth and I feel so embarrassed about the kind of visitor experience that we are showing to international tourists who just want to come here for a good time with their family..."

Regardless to say of their services , all the ladies were so gorgeous.\n\nOn the other hand, unlike other club ,bottles purchased is valid for 6 months\nIt's worth of  what you spend.\n\nThe room is so comfortable with the best sofa and superb karaoke system. I will be definitely comes to the club again and im willing to spent a lot because Club Amairo is the most exclusive and best Japenese Club in Singapore!\n\nSo guys i would likely reconmend you all to head down to this club and check it out. I assure you guys might not regret but instead you will be tempting to come back again...!"

Went in for a consultation for discomfort in stomach: $40 Consultation, $113 for 1 week medication. Total $153!\nNeedless to say I was gobsmacked when I saw the bill.\n\nAlso, doctor was pushing for acupuncture right off the bat. Luckily I read some reviews beforehand saying they will try to push services onto you so I declined.\n\nI have been to other TCMs which were very good but never have I seen such pricing. I for one will never visit this place again.\n\nI let you decide for yourself if this pricing is reasonable."

It‚Äôs a big open room separated by curtains, no privacy for women. And it looks unhygienic. A 1.5 hour ‚Äúpain management tuina‚Äù cost $190+. The ‚Äúpain management‚Äùis a fancy term they use to charge more. All their branches claim ‚Äútuina‚Äù has no effect and ask u to pay for the ‚Äúpain management‚Äù.

The reception staff were courteous and provided clear explanations regarding medications and prescriptions.  Dr. Caleb Teo delivered outstanding patient care, demonstrating friendliness, attentiveness, patience, and kindness.  My fifteen-day skin allergy responded remarkably well to the prescribed medication, showing positive results from the first day. The clinic's convenient location is also a significant advantage. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Caleb Teo for dermatological consultations.  Thank you to the entire team.  For optimal service, I suggest scheduling appointments before 7:00 PM, ensuring Dr. Teo and the excellent support staff are available.üôèüòÄ"

They charge $10 if you choose doctor which is very telling why they need to have this in place because one of the doctors is not as good hence less preferred by many. Time in doctor's in doctor's room is less than 3 min with little explanation by the doc. Overall just a clinic to get the bucks out of you with little regard of you as a patient."

The staff have always been helpful ‚Äî most of them willingly cut the chicken into 4 pieces for me upon request.\n\nHowever, I have repeatedly encountered poor service from one staff member named Lily. On several occasions, she refused to cut the chicken, giving various reasons ‚Äî such as ‚Äúthe chicken is on sale‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs the weekend and there are too many customers.‚Äù This has happened multiple times, yet her colleagues have always been able to provide the same service without issue.\n\nWhen I raised this with the store manager, Mr. Puah, he confirmed that cutting the chicken is part of their service, regardless of whether it is on sale or how busy it is. I hope top management will address this inconsistency so that customers can enjoy a consistent level of service from all staff members."

  "text": "It was my first time visiting this Cold Storage outlet to buy fresh fish. I selected a larger piece and asked the service staff to help cut it into smaller portions and pack them into separate bags, so I could cook them on different days.\n\nHowever, after the staff finished cutting the fish, I noticed he did not wear gloves during the entire process. Even more concerning, he handled the raw fish with bare hands and didn‚Äôt wash his hands before placing the pieces into the plastic bags. Later, when he handled another clean bag for storing other raw meat, he still didn‚Äôt wash his hands beforehand.\n\nThis is a serious hygiene issue that could lead to cross-contamination and increase the risk of foodborne illness or even something more severe. It was extremely upsetting and unacceptable to witness such unsafe food handling practices.\n\nI sincerely hope the management takes this matter seriously and ensures all staff are properly trained before assigning them to such important roles. No customer should have to worry about food poisoning due to poor hygiene standards."

As I was pushing a trolley and unknowingly approached the area, this staff member stood nearby and abruptly shouted ‚ÄúOi!‚Äù before pointing at the spill. His expression was extremely hostile!\nalmost as if to say, ‚ÄúAre you blind?‚Äù It was unnecessarily aggressive and humiliating.\n\nOn another occasion, I witnessed him act rudely toward a couple browsing at the bakery section. He arrived with multiple carts and attempted to push through a narrow space without saying ‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù or asking politely. Instead, he glared at the couple with an exaggerated, wide-eyed stare, silently pressuring them to move. Startled, they quickly stepped aside. It was uncomfortable to witness.\n\nLater, when I went to pay for my items, I told the cashier that I‚Äôd return shortly to grab a few more packs of blueberries. I placed my cart aside temporarily. This same staff member then ordered me to push my cart over and return to the bakery area, even though I had already informed the cashier of my plan. It felt controlling and unnecessary.\n\nFortunately, another staff member noticed and kindly offered to help move my cart. His helpful attitude stood in stark contrast to the rude behavior I‚Äôve described.\n\nStaff training and professionalism are essential to the shopping experience. Customers should never feel intimidated or disrespected. I sincerely hope CS Fresh takes this feedback seriously and addresses this individual‚Äôs behavior appropriately."

Waited a week after the treatments to observe the effects before posting a review.\n\nBasically some part of the chronic stiffness I had in my left shoulder and upper back was taken care of. Not that it's totally gone (can't expect that from just two sessions...), but I'd say it was a structural / fundamental kind of change, not just dealing with the surface / symptom level. I've had spine issues for many years and also surgery, and have seen a number of physiotherapists, chiropractors, get massages weekly etc. etc., and I'd say I've not had therapy that's had such a significant change before.\n\nThank you to HelenÂßê, and will definitely plan on visiting again in any next Singapore trip."

Dr Koh is very patient and explains thoroughly results of tests carried out and often works with me on a cause of treatment that I am comfortable with. Also he responds very promptly to email enquiries as well. His team of staff in the clinic are also super helpful and will try their best to accommodate whenever possible.

Music is old school, the 90s babies would definitely know the playlist. There is carpark nearby. Not sure if it's overrated or this is a place more suitable for having alcohol ü§î\n\nüçù 100 China Points Noodles with prawn paste chicken cutlet - $15.90\n2.5\n- not worth the price. The chicken is super salty. Noodle is just indomie instant noodles, very delicious.\n\nüçÑüç≤üçû Truffle Mushroom Soup with garlic bread - $12.90\n3.0\n- taste like added MSG. We can feel the truffle after swallowing but is very salty and can't taste the mushroom at all üòÇ so not the usual mushroom soup we had. First time seeing oil on top of mushroom soup, suspecting if it's truffle oil? Not sure. And the garlic bread is hard to bite, need to dip inside the soup and wait for it to turn soft.\n\nüçî Wagyu Half-Pounder add truffle fries - $22.90\n3.5\nThe burger not bad, fries is hot, crispy and taste good.

  "text": "1-Star Review (Would give zero if possible)\nThe worst karaoke experience ever\n\nIt‚Äôs a Friday night and we arrived at this karaoke place around 9 PM and were given a room that had apparently already started at 9, which we didn‚Äôt mind. Not realizing it was a bar setting, we made the mistake of bringing our own drinks. Shortly after starting our session, the 1st female staff member entered to inform us that outside drinks weren‚Äôt allowed. We apologized, explained it was our first time there, and we would order food and drinks from the venue. She was understanding and told us not to do it again.\n\nHowever, things quickly turned ridiculous. Within the next 5 minutes, a 2nd female staff member came in to repeat the same message. We again apologized and reiterated that we had placed orders with them.\n\nThen, less than 2 minutes later, a 3rd male staff member entered to tell us again that outside drinks weren‚Äôt allowed and warned he‚Äôd come back to check. We complied and placed the drinks into a paper bag. But before even a minute had passed, a fourth staff member entered, this time asking to confiscate our drinks and store them at the counter. We refused, as the drinks were already opened and half-consumed ‚Äî we had no idea what might happen to them once out of our sight.\n\nThroughout the entire 2-hour session, staff continued to peek into our room repeatedly, making us feel like we were under surveillance. It felt less like a karaoke session and more like being in a monitored holding cell. Aren‚Äôt they busy on a Friday night, why would they do it to such extent?\n\nIf outside drinks are strictly prohibited, the staff could have simply refused us entry or asked us to leave at the start. Instead, they allowed us in, took our card, and then spent the rest of the time interrupting and policing us, ruining what should have been an enjoyable night.\n\nAbsolutely terrible service. I would give zero stars if I could. Avoid this place at all costs"

Michael was very helpful over the phone and advised me to bring the sales order receipt to the store. When I dropped by, he was warm and welcoming, making the entire process smooth and pleasant. Truly a delightful after-sales experience!"

  "text": "Bought a Panasonic fridge from BD IMM in May for my elderly mother. It was delivered a few days later but it broke down the following day. Only my mum was at home to receive the fridge on that day. The technician came the next day and reported the issue was due to ‚Äúsystem failure‚Äù. Reported the matter to BD and requested for a 1 to 1 exchange which they did a few days later. Upon closer investigation, it was discovered that the fridge was delivered without any box packaging (red flag) and also the Instruction Manual was not wrapped in the usual sealed plastic bag (another red flag). Filed a complaint to Panasonic (no reply yet after 10 days) and BD (only received a call from a warehouse person claiming that the defective fridge was new). For me, it‚Äôs either a Grade B stock or a repaired set or a display set. No official explanation from BD and Panasonic. Very disappointed with the whole episode. To future BD customers, please make sure that your new appliances are delivered in its original sealed box packaging and witness that it is unpacked in front of you."

Had totally spoiled the mood for countdown into a new year. No table was excited for the countdown.\nThere was dancers as well however, it was 2 ladyboy and we were shocked by the choice of dancers for a countdown event.\n\nFew months ago when I was there on a weekday and there was 0 people inside other than us however, the dj xen was extremely good.\n\nThe only star given was to 1 of their staff who was looking after our table. He was very friendly and attentive and took care of our table. He even gave complimentary snacks as it was our friend birthday."

Tucked away in a cozy corner of biopolis, this place is a perfect blend of charm, comfort, and quality.\n\nThe coffee? Absolutely outstanding. I have had their signature inhouse blends. Easily one of the best cups I‚Äôve had in Singapore.\n\nWhat truly sets this caf√© apart is the warm, friendly service. The baristas were incredibly knowledgeable and happy to recommend beverages based on our preferences. You can tell they‚Äôre passionate about their craft.\n\nThe ambience is another win: authentic raw nofrills cafe, and plenty of natural light make it a great spot to chill, catch up on work, or meet friends.\n\nWe also shared a slice of their homemade banana, lemon cake, which was divine‚Äîmoist, fragrant, and not too sweet. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back to try their other small bakes items.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast or just looking for a peaceful spot to unwind, Little Big C R is a must-visit. Highly recommended!"

  "text": "MY THOUGHTS ON ACCORD AUTO SERVICES @ 09 JUN 2025\n\nI visited Accord Auto Services (Accord) at its 1009 Bukit Merah Lane workshop Monday, 02 June 2025 before my travel on Sat, 07 June 2025 and I like to share my good impressions on the competence and professionalism of the team especially, Gilbert and Ah Hao.\n\nI observed that Accord has the precise BMW diagnostic tools and professional expertise to diagnose and systematically assess ‚Äúthe morning cold start idling‚Äù issue which I have been experiencing for a few months.\n\nFrom checks and research thus far, I understand that the cold start issue (apparently common to many older BMW cars) could be caused by (1) some faulty ECU sensors; or/and (2) clogged fuel injector/sin cylinders; and/or (3) overnight fuel injectors‚Äô bleeding‚Ä¶\n\nI must say that I truly appreciate the Accord service team‚Äôs professional diligence and comprehensive cum thorough diagnosis of the car‚Äôs engine and ECU sensors. The diagnostic process took about two odd hours and the Accord team managed to diagnose that the Nitrogen Oxide or NOx sensor [which was replaced in July 2023 by another workshop but unsure if that NOx sensor replaced then had been correctly coded] is faulty and unwittingly send erroneous signals to the ECU and causing the morning cold start and (unfortunate cum annoying) rough idling issue ‚Ä¶\n\nOn the very next day, Tue, 03 Jun 2025, the Accord  team promptly texted the quote and estimated downtime to replace the NOx sensor. As I am travelling now, I look forward to arranging the NOx sensor replacement with Accord when I return from my travel  in late June  2025.\n\nI shall also try to update/ cross-share and cross-learn further for those who have same or other engine issues concerning their BMW cars."

When I sent my car in, I was attended to by Jing Rong who is down-to-earth, no drama, explaining the repair process clearly. The price quoted is much cheaper than 2 other places that I asked, where they acted like my damage was irreparable and needed replacement parts. Jing Rong simply stated what he could and could not do, and how much it costed, which was a very reasonable price. The car came back good as new and I knew this was the place I would go to if I ever needed another repair.\n\nNow in 2025, two of my car doors got damaged. Jing Rong attended to me again, was transparent and prompt in giving me the quotation. No up-sell, and updated me with realistic turnaround time. Bonus, he was attentive and reminded me to take my valuables with me, but I still forgot some things, so I texted him to help me with safekeeping and he was ever so patient and helpful. They also accept Paywave which is great. I would highly recommend if you need your car body repair done. In fact, I am so happy with the service here that I am writing my Google review out of my own initiative!"

I was looking for ceiling fans and the owner explained and demonstrated several types of fan available in the shop in terms of wind coverage & strength, the light temperature, the wind noise, room type, the remote control and pros/cons.  I have learned something new while chatting with the owner.  Thanks for the sharing of knowledge."

It was completely unrelated to the previous repair when he was finished, i asked how much and the technician recognized me and he said it fine.\n\nI dont know his name but I WILL ALWAYS remember your kind gesture today. You sensed me in trouble and wanted to help me just like that. Thank you!\n\nAnyone who wants an affordable and honest repair option in Singapore, pls visit this place."

I initially visited a competitor store nearby but they were reluctant to help me as it was quite late already, hence I decided to take a leap of faith here instead.\n\nI was attended to by Jack who was very professional and courteous. He managed to diagnose the problem in a couple of minutes as a blown motherboard fuse and gave me a reasonable and transparent quotation to fix the problem.\n\n3 days later, my iPhone is working as good as a brand new phone again! Jack was also very gracious to add in a free screen protector replacement for me as he had to remove the old one while disassembling my phone. The repair also came with a 3 month warranty. Overall, a 5 star service and I would recommend coming here for phone repair services. Keep up the good work!"

Not far off from the Mr Mobile that is downstairs.\n- Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Managed to get my LCD repaired and running on the same day. They take 10 - 30 mins for LCD repairs.\n- Staff even threw in a new screen protector for me :)\n- There‚Äôs a 3 months warranty included for repairs, so there‚Äôs some ease of mind if the phone gives you problems again after you have repaired it.\n\n‚ùå\n- There was a slight hiccup where the initial LCD used was not compatible with my phone and there were still some glitchy/black spots on my phone.\n\nStaff told me that he will get a compatible version sent in to the store later that day and to come back to get the phone fully repaired. Appreciated this arrangement because our phones are very essential to us in this day and age.\n\nOverall really satisfied with the repair and service provided."

Giant staffs are friendly and helpful, except for 1 person, ms. Huang or Shuang, one with short boyish hairstyle (I didn't get her surname). She has never assisted to pack my groceries whenever I bring my own shopping bags. She would only pack when I pass her my bags and ask for her help while I make payment or putting my cash into my wallet.\n\nNever ever have I wanted to complain about her but base on my last experience is my last drawn with her. I asked her to help me to pack my groceries while I put my money back into my purse (I have pack half of it myself) and yet, she went ahead and process transaction for other customer. In the end, I pack by myself.\n\nOther staffs usually help me pack my groceries into my bags without me asking for their help. That includes cashier staffs at FairPrice or Cold Storage.\n\nI think, it is part of their respnsibilities to pack for their customer whethet they pay for plastic bag or using their own shopping bag. Unless Giants has a different policy.\n\nIf customer has to packed their own groceries when they bring their own shopping bag, might as well add in more self check out counters and please make sure self check out counters are working. The machines are not even working most of the days.\n\nI hope Giant would take my feedback into consideration and improve customer shopping experience from good to excellent."

  "text": "Stayed for 4 nights in July 2025. The location is good, just a few minutes walk from Bugis MRT station, and there are many restaurants nearby.However, I give it one star out of five. I don't know about the women's room, but there is only one water tap (sink) for the men's room for over 50 people. There are only four toilets and showers, two separate ones and two in each room. This doesn't seem to violate Singapore law, but it clearly shows the owner's attitude towards his guests. In the morning, you often have to fight with other people over the sink, and it's normal to wait 5-10 minutes. It's not cleaned and dirty.There are also numerous shoes and slippers left in a mess at the entrance, including disposable slippers that have been thrown away. Footwear is not permitted inside the building, but the floors are dirty and indoor beach sandals are a must.There is a refrigerator, but it is not organized at all, and there is rotten food left there, giving off a foul odor, so new guests should assume that it is practically unusable. The price is close to the lowest in the area, so the clientele is extremely poor. The room is small, and there are many suitcases at the entrance, so the door sometimes cannot be opened. There is no space to pack luggage inside the room."

I've went to the cheapest car workshops to service my car before but it cannot be compared to Riverview Auto. I also think it's better to do a good one for my six year old car rather than going to a cheaper but lousy alternative.\n\nIt was worth the money. Not only were they friendly and helpful when I was in doubt, the boss recommended what work was needed to be done for my car. There were many parts that needed to be changed that the previous workshops didn't tell me to.\n\nAfter servicing, my car ride was smoother. My car didn't vibrate so much anymore and my steering wheel was so smooth like butter. It was as if my car is brand new.\n\nHighly recommend their car servicing!"

They did a diagnostic check and said revealed that my car horn is not working and there is Nothing Wrong with my airbag and my car battery was okay.

The place was buzzing with many stalls opened and we were spoiled for. Hoi e. We settled for the zhi Czar stall as the selection were great and met our needs and budget. The the sweet & sour pork ribs didn't disappoint. It was tender and juicy with good aroma and sweet/sour flavour. The bitter gourd with salted egg was just as good. First we try this recipe & found it lightly sauteed with just the right amount of oil. We like this coffeeshope and will definitely go back again."

Rude, dismissive, and clearly has no idea how to manage a team or a guest list.\n\nCustomer service? Nonexistent. Accountability? Also missing. Hospitality?

She will slowly increase in strength as she firmly press your sore spots.\nI would say that her massage is both soothing and relaxing and I have oftenly dozed on and off during the session. Good use of fingers, hands, and elbows to target those problem areas.\nOverall very worth my travel and time."

The ushers at the entrance are very arrogant, talk to you as if they want to beat you up!\n\nI bought a voucher on Grab and the terms and condition only stated that the voucher should be redeemed on either Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. I went on a Saturday night, and showed them that I was there to redeem my voucher. The staff at the entrance told me I couldn‚Äôt use it because they had a special guest that night and wanted to 'avoid losses.'\n\nWhen I asked which terms and conditions could prevent me from entering because of the presence of special guests, they told me it's their decision now and they would inform Grab partnership team next time. It becomes my own problem and I should deal with Grab myself instead!\n\nInterestingly, the staff then admitted that the voucher is a clickbait as they don't want the customer to redeem the voucher, even though the voucher has stated that it should be redeemed within the specified day and period.\n\nDoes this imply that Zouk being a big and trusted corporation are playing click bait to cheat the customers? This is not only unprofessional but also completely disregards the rights of your customers!\n\nWhen I asked to record their statement to raise dispute against Grab, one of the staff touched my phone and raised her tone towards me. This is completely unacceptable. First, did you have permission to touch my personal property? Second, how can you not take responsibility for what you've said, yet still represent Zouk?\n\nI asked for their manager's email and emailed them the day after. But even after 4 days, there's no reply at all. So GO AT YOUR OWN RISK!"

Therefore when calculate with other jewelry shops, its still cheaper and you get to save more.\nThere's an option to pay via 3 month installment with no interest fee..\nIf more than 3 month then there's 0.7% interest added (which is reasonable).\nCan walk in to pay any date within the month, flexible.\n\nGood value for the deal.\nüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"

In the hall karaoke system, we were told they closed at 1am so they cut the songs at each table to one song per table, to meet the 1am deadline. Then we noticed it wasn‚Äôt the case and several other tables were allowed to continue singing past 1am. Eventually we realised these customers who were allowed to sing past 1am were familiar with the staff. We asked one of the staff and he said it‚Äôs ‚Äúlady boss‚Äôs decision‚Äù. Didn‚Äôt want to make things difficult for him as he‚Äôs just a staff. Come at your own risk, if you‚Äôd like to be treated as second class citizens."

(For me personally, i would rather go to other small stores which are located just beside this particular outlet if i see her working in the daytime just to avoid being in contact with her.)\n\n19/8/2023 0200AM\nWe were walking into this outlet and she was assorting the frozen section . My friend tried to reach the pasta which is also in the frozen section.(He did not make any physical contact with her and he had no intention either.) Suddenly she started flipping out and threatened to call 999 for not saying ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù. She raised her tone at the customers who did nothing wrong but just to get some snacks. I‚Äôm not sure she only did this because we‚Äôre not Singaporeans? Anyways, take actions please.\n\n(Again, we‚Äôve been tolerating for awhile)"

The bottle expired in 1 month time. So yesterday 12/8/2023 we went down to club slim again to claim out left over bottle (Chivas 18) sadly the staff and managers there come back to us that our bottle had been redeem on the 8/8/2023 which we never went down on that day.\n\nThe managers was telling me that so sadly that your name and phone number of the bottle had been redeemed. Which I can also said that your staff use my name and phone number keyed into your system and told me that the bottle had been redeemed! At the end of the day they just came back to me that our system showed your name had redeemed and did not do any further service recovery!\n\nThe other sad things about it was yesterday we open beer tower and the promo is 2+1 they are conflict also. Total we had 2+1(3sets) plus 1 tower which mean we total have 10 tower but we counted that everytime we asked for the 2+1 when after served the 2 tower the other 1 tower the staff will told us that we had redeemed but we was not redeemed yet.\n\nWe all just feel that this club slim not honour serving us. The management need to have more proper system!"

He promised to speak to the receptionists so hope situation will improve in the future.\nReceptionists have poor understanding of workflow, gave wrong information and still talked down on patients and arrogant.\n1. Enquired on COVID vaccine and RSV vaccine. COVID vaccine needs to register on MOH webpage but NOT the clinic webpage (as advised to scan QR code of clinic at the counter). Only acknowledged this mistake after I offered twice to show them my phone.Told me no RSV vaccine available when it‚Äôs shown on website with price. Clearly they don‚Äôt even know what vaccine services are provided at the clinic and are too lazy to even look up upon request.\n2. Vaccine record was missed by the first doctor to upload to healthHUB. Could be easily corrected by checking with the doctor. However receptionists first dismissed my request and told me to check with MOH??! Only upon insisting did they register me to clarify with the doctor who admitted it was a missed upload and amended on the spot.\n3. Maid health check up records. We told the receptionists that we need a copy and the receptionists said they‚Äôd call us back in about 1 week to collect result. No phone call or follow up. Had to walk in to get result again. Told today that the routine practice is to just upload result to MOM as most customers don‚Äôt want a copy?\nAll mistakes could have been cordially resolved but the receptionists talking down on patients simply made the experience truly unpleasant."

And those care measures were on the instruction of the medication he gave me. He also told me to go back to see him if the medicine doesn't work after some time. I know from my reading that it will take at least 6 months to see results, but he said to go back to him in a few weeks if I don't see results. This advice again does not match up correctly with the medicine instruction which said 6-12 months.\n\nI got the correct medicine, but poor instructions from him on how to use it. I felt that he doesn't really know how to take care of my medical issue, gave incorrect advice, and in general was not taking his job and myself very seriously."

I also asked her how long I can store them in the freezer and she said not longer than 2 months. I saw her packed them individually in bags of 2 slices so I didn‚Äôt check the bag after I reached home and immediately stored in the freezer. Three days later, I removed them from the freezer and realised that she had bags with 2 slices and there is one big bag with a harden chunk of 4 thick slices of salmon which was so hardened that I had to let it thaw under running water. This is unbelievable as I know that fish after thawing is not advisable to store back in the freezer. The salmon slices become all smashed up after thawing (see photos). Feel so annoyed and disappointed with this type of service."

Understand it may be busy on a weekend, but it is definitely not right to throw out their emotional displeasure to customers if they are feeling stressed. They can definitely do better."

He was not only super efficient and patient, he guided us through payment calmly when paying with both CDC vouchers and thru the app. But MOST OF ALL, I left my mobile phone behind at the counter and he swiftly kept it for me, waiting for my return! It was a Saturday evening, super crowded and without his efficiency and hawk eye, someone else might have used the counter and walked away with my phone. So HUGE THANKS & KUDOS to you, Darren! Thank you!!! You made my weekend!"

Went to their branch, got the repair with a \"3-month warranty.\" I pointed out a scratch immediately, but they said it was just dirt! Now there's a bright white spot that wasn't there before! The manufacturer is just rabak!\n\nTheir customer service (via WhatsApp) is APPALLING. Instant replies from another's phone pretending to be a new customer, but \"bohlayan\" when I tried to claim my warranty. After ranting to \"Desmond\" on WhatsApp, he offered a refund AND a new LCD. I refused because their rabak customer service made me lose all trust. They suddenly claimed my phone had a bloated battery and could damage the screen, wanting to \"check\" it. Sketchy!\n\nLiteMobile needs to prioritize warranty claims and acknowledge issues instead of dismissing them. First and last time customer here. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else!\n\n#Singapore #CustomerServiceFail #TikTokMadeMeTryItAndItFailed #WarrantyNightmare #Rabak #ShadyBusiness"

Turns out, it was just a DSG oil change that was needed even though I had it done previously. Yes it may seem like an easy fix, but not all ws can do it the oem way of replacing fluids, draining excess oil after correct warm up temp, conducting adaption drive etc. Kudos to Royston, Meryl and team for their professional service and advice. Action speaks louder than words, i have been there, experienced it myself, and I only trust them ever since then."

Coupled with his friendly attitude and demeanour it always feels like hanging out with a friend when visiting his shop.\n\nRepairs are done professionally and he was able to assess my cars issue in one test drive.  Drive back to workshop and get the things fixed and viola the it felt like driving a car again.\n\nNo hard sales and pushy tactics , in fact due to my suspension being so hard I wanted to change to another brand. Roy suggested me to try his fix and if I still insist he will recommend a different setup. Needless to say I saved myself some $$$ and time.\n\nHighly recommended to visit once before you make big decisions of changing spares or car.  He is quite busy so please take appointment before going down."

However that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt handle Non VAG cars. They have worked on my Honda, my BMW and on my other friends Toyota, Lexus and many more! They have solved problems even on a Rolls Royce Ghost that other supposed workshops thought they could. And why? This boils down to EFFORT, KNOWLEDGE and COMMITMENT that is deeply rooted into this power team. The commitment that is derived from the NEVER SAY DIE spirit of theirs is something I deeply respect ü´°\n\nThose who know me know I don‚Äôt trust workshops easily but Squad is the 1 of ONLY 2 Workshops I patronise whom I can entrust my car to and simply go for a holiday even and know that the car is in trustable good hands.\n\n3 Cheers for this wonderful hardworking and knowledgeable team, who are always me and my cars their best!!"

Dr April and team has always provided top tier professionalism - from clearly explaining dental plans (I started with metal braces) to customer service towards anything I need. For the former, my braces journey took 5 years and I was always well informed (plus my consent explicitly sought) of the assessments and plans of what we‚Äôre doing and why we‚Äôre doing that. And for the latter, there were already a few ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù where I either broke a bracket or my retainers and they would make a few work arounds to accommodate my schedule as best as they can.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a pleasure to be a patient at this clinic and I foresee that I will stick with them for all my dental needs for the foreseeable future :)"

The dish itself and the chili goes well together, and the flavors were on point too. We also had the truffle fries. It was very crispy and addictive! We kept reaching out for more and wished the portion was bigger ü§§ The last dish was muah Chee. I like that it‚Äôs not too sweet, and the texture was slightly softer, maybe because it was served hot. If you like to drink and are looking for a chill and cozy place to vibe with your friends, LUSS is the place to go. They have an extensive range of alcoholic drinks; you will definitely be spoiled for choices. The staff were friendly, attentive, and approachable. We met the lady boss as well, and she‚Äôs very friendly and pretty. Overall, we had an amazing night there and hope to be back again!"

We came down right after school, and even though I was carrying a bulky bag with my wrestling shoes dangling on the side, they welcomed us without complaint. From the steps up to the last meal, the food, service and atmosphere were excellent.\n\nWe were told that there was a bustling crowd right before we came, so 9pm seems to be the quietest time, in case anyone has the same idea for a date!\n\nThe food: We ordered the Pasta, Mala, Pork Belly Skewers, Crab Meat and Buns, two Mocktails, and the Cheese Platter. Each one was as good as the next, and the prices were very reasonably priced for the amazing quality.\n\nThe place: The restaurant is situated around a quiet, off the road curb, with stairs leading up to it. It is nested within beautiful nature, with air-conditioned indoor seating, and outdoor seating as well. The restaurant's manager, I believe, was extremely accommodating, and we spoke for a bit. She also adjusted the air-condition for us when we felt chilly.\n\nBefore we left, she gave us two roses, which are very appreciated =)\n\nOverall, the whole experience was just really, really pleasant. This will be our new date night spot, and honestly we wanted to gatekeep this...but we also want this place to thrive, so there you go! Visit this place, you will not regret it.\n\nSide note: As two young University students, we aren't normally paid much attention to at restaurants, which is all well and good since I'm happy having our alone time, but it is a really appreciated and welcoming gesture from the waiters and manager to speak to us. A refreshing experience indeed!"

I came in as a walk-in at 730am today right before the opening time at 8am because I was vomiting badly and feeling extremely lightheaded in the morning. I‚Äôve also been visiting this clinic for an eye infection, so it made sense to come back here.\n\nAt the registration counter, I told the Chinese lady that I was feeling very unwell and couldn‚Äôt go to a GP because I was lightheaded and could throw up anytime. I also explained that I‚Äôm on ComCare and can‚Äôt afford to go to a private clinic. Still, she said they will only see case that is urgent and that the doctor‚Äôs schedule was fully booked, and just told me to buy medicine from the pharmacy.\n\nBut I‚Äôd already taken medicine, and I needed a doctor to assess what was actually wrong. I felt helpless.\n\nI‚Äôm really grateful to the Indian lady near the self-check-in kiosk who saw how pale I looked and told me to keep checking the app for any available slots. She was the only one who showed concern when I could barely see clearly anymore.\n\nIt‚Äôs frustrating and disheartening to be turned away when you‚Äôre visibly unwell. The least u could do is make an effort and go an extra mile.I hope they can better assess such situations, especially for those of us facing financial difficulties."

They also provide rubber slipper to use around hostel. Decent shower room, also clean with hot water, clean toilet too. They provode clean towel and blanket too.\n\nYou also can wash and iron your clothes, since they provide washing machine and iron board. Also locker to stash your valuable things.\n\nAnd luckyly, all my room mate were quiet one, no snore ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠\n\nLove their cute big cats."

Scammy, unprofessional and dishonest, so let me share my experience.\n\nMy car had issues with my side mirror, so i sent it down to be fixed as per my dealership (Vincar) instructions.\n\nFirst off, they never informed me that the car had to be collected the next day, was under the impression it could be collected in the same day. I stayed in the area and only when it was 5pm and I gave them a call, then they told me it could be collected the next day.\n\nSecondly, collected the car, mirror was jerky. They assured me it was a new part issue, tried to put some oil but issue was not resolved.\n\nLastly and the worse part, I just discovered these incapable staff curbed my rim when my car was with them and painted it over black which was why I didn't realise when I collected the car. Only realised when I was washing my own car and realised they didn't sand the part down. I was never informed of this and trying to cover this up just shows how dishonest they are.\n\nHonestly, a bunch of unprofessional and dishonest people working here. Please avoid them at all cost."

Ideally, i would have liked a refund on the cake alone too. It doesnt seem right to have paid for a cake with a staple bullet and which was thrown away half eaten."

  "text": "Samsung Online Store GROSS MISREPRESENTATION OF STOCK DELIVERY AND INVENTORY. I would avoid buying from Samsung. Bought S25 on Samsung online store and was notified of delayed delivery via SMS. No further follow ups after a week. I had to call into Samsung customer service 3 times on my own to figure out when the delivery would happen. Turned out they didn't figure out their stocks properly and ran OOS of Pink. Was asked to change my phone colour so that the delivery could be arranged. Absolutely no service recovery. I had to recover it for them. It is astounding that buying direct from Samsung I was deprived of obtaining the desired phone model on time. Will never be buying from Samsung ever again."

I trusted a globally renowned brand, paid a premium, and ended up with dead pixels on my screen. A quality control issue that has been reported by countless customers worldwide ‚Äî and yet, Samsung still pretends it‚Äôs not a problem.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse.\n\nWhen I reached out to Samsung Singapore‚Äôs customer care, hoping for a solution, I was met with a level of indifference that was honestly insulting. Instead of helping, they had the audacity to say:\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know how you handled the phone.‚Äù\nSeriously? That‚Äôs your response? Not only are your devices flawed, but now it‚Äôs the customer‚Äôs fault for expecting them to work?\n\nI‚Äôm baffled. A flagship product with a screen issue and a support team that gaslights the user. This isn‚Äôt just bad service ‚Äî it‚Äôs pathetic. For a company that spends millions on marketing and brand image, your actual product quality and support are a disgrace.\n\nTo anyone considering a Samsung device: don‚Äôt.\nDead pixels, dead accountability, and dead silence when it comes to real customer issues."

On January 11, 2025, I ordered the S24FE as part of a flash deal that included a power adapter and phone cover, opting for self-collection at the Samsung Experience Store at Compass One on January 14, 2025.\n\nWhen I collected the phone on January 16, 2025, the power adapter and phone cover were missing. The staff explained that this was due to a website issue, which they had already reported to the Samsung hotline, and advised me to contact Samsung directly.\n\nWhen I reached out to customer care, the manager's response was unprofessional, stating that disciplinary action would be taken against the retail staff for providing \"incorrect\" information. This is unacceptable, as the staff acknowledged the issue and responsibly reported it to headquarters.\n\nIf the flash deal did not include free items, why were they displayed in the cart during checkout? Customers should not have to endure misleading website information and inadequate issue resolution."

I began to doubt Samsung's brand reliability and explained to the agent hotline that I do not want a replacement but I am seeking a full REFUND from Samsung right now and I do not want to support Samsung anymore! I bought this NEW model for CNY uses but right now Samsung is not attending to my issues as I told them I need a confirmation for the refund before I can proceed to buy another new mic rowave oven.Called the agent hotline a few times and spoken to so many Customer Care ( Name: Pinky, Lee and the latest one being Celicia) but was told that a refund report have been submitted to Samsung but I still need to wait ! This is really causing inconvenience to me especially so during this festive season as I can't use microwave oven till it is resolved. Will not support Samsung further as their after sales service is terrible and let a customer waits indefinitely for current issues to be resolved, thumb down to Samsung !!"

  "text": "I purchased a brand-new Samsung S24 Ultra, expecting a premium product and service to match. Instead, I‚Äôve been met with nothing but frustration and disappointment.\n\nStraight out of the box, the phone's camera was completely non-functional‚Äîa glaring hardware defect. For a device that is supposed to represent the pinnacle of Samsung‚Äôs innovation, this was an appalling start.\n\nWhen I contacted Samsung, I made what I believe was a simple and reasonable request: an immediate replacement for a brand-new, defective product. To my shock, Samsung refused and insisted I take the phone to their service center for evaluation and potential repair. This demand is utterly unacceptable. Why should I, as a paying customer, have to jump through hoops to repair a product that was faulty from the start?\n\nI escalated the issue, hoping for a better resolution. Two days later, Samsung called back‚Äîonly to repeat the same unhelpful response: no replacement, only repair. Their refusal to offer a replacement demonstrates a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. A company of Samsung‚Äôs stature should have a no-questions-asked replacement policy for defective products.\n\nAs if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the first customer service agent handling my case refused to provide his/her name when asked, showing a total lack of transparency and accountability. This evasive and dismissive behavior further underscores the inadequacies in Samsung‚Äôs customer service.\n\nThis entire ordeal‚Äîfrom receiving a defective product to the appallingly poor customer service‚Äîhas left me deeply disappointed. For anyone considering buying from Samsung, be warned: if something goes wrong, you‚Äôll be left to deal with a frustrating and unsympathetic system. This experience has seriously made me reconsider my loyalty to the brand.\n\nVerdict: Avoid. Samsung's handling of this situation has been nothing short of a disaster."

Waiter was forever busy chatting with other customers, took his own sweet time to take our order\n2. Stout came after a few minutes but the Heineken didn't. Literally and I repeat without exaggerating, it must have taken at least 10-15 mins for the 3rd Beer that's on tap to come. I mean really?? How long does it take to pour a glass from a tap. It was clear that the service was really disappointing and it almost felt like some other customers were being given priority.\n3. The fries never came btw. 30-45 mins of sitting there, no one said anything, Enquired and was told 'oh there's only one chef today. Could have given a heads-up before taking the order or at least told us while we were waiting forever just to have fries along with Beer.\n\nClearly they were incapable of handling Friday evening crowd. Never ever.\n\nWent to Bar Bar Black sheep at HV after that and the service was impeccable. Food came within 5 mins of ordering, just fyi, so please just go there and save your Friday evening!!"

Indeed they didn‚Äôt seem to have issues with us eating outside, but despite us eating outside their busy hours (around 6PM), they forbade us from reconfiguring the seating layout such that we could eat together. Instead, we were forced to split the group into three smaller groups. To make things worse, the attitudes of the staff were poor, and many of them acted very crudely and indifferently towards us. We felt very unwelcome. Decent food overall.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt during their peak or popular hours, so the experience might differ then!"

However, I must say the staff service does get a 5-star rating for me as coming in at 1 am the staff member was SUPER helpful, offering me even some food after travelling late night, very nice service. ||||The dormitory rooms were in a very old style layout and design, it looked more run down to me than old-style but this is more just personal preference, the beds and bunks are a bit hard but for a budget hostel more than fine enough. The showers are a bit weirdly designed in dorms but otherwise, I had no problems staying here with a quick layover personally."

Similar concept to mingle in KL but it just didnt work... breakfast is toast and tea and 2 vanilla loafs  thats the highlight. The showers are combined with the toilets so there always wet or busy. There isnt really a common area just some tables in a narrow hall way with damp and peeling paint. Beds are ok and staff are brilliant. 3/10. We have  great 4k & 360¬∞ footage of this on our channel seewhatwesee 360 .. and great pics and tips on how and where to go and not to go in Singapore on our IG page seewhatwesee_"

They didn't even greet the customers when they first came to serve them, and when the two of us greeted them, they didn't even bother to respond and were very rude to the customers... We came to the spa hoping to relax, but from the very first moment, I felt that the staff were very rude and had a bad attitude... Then my boyfriend asked if she could have three massages, but she replied with a bad attitude that she didn't know... If this spa wants to have more customers, they should remove and discipline such staff, they will only make the spa lose all customers and they will never come back... What a terrible experience, a waste of money to relax, and I am even more upset and disappointed 01:58 am"

I took a cab over, but just few minutes before arriving, she informed me that she had overlooked earlier bookings and that I would now have to wait an hour.\n\nIt was close to midnight, and with nowhere else to go, I asked if the cab fare could be reimbursed given the sudden change. Instead, I was met with excuses ‚Äî that she was new, crossed in and out of JB, had to pay rent, etc. She even went on to say Singaporeans are ‚Äúcalculative,‚Äù I told her it's not a matter of being a Singaporean but about professionalism, she insisted that she's right and that she never faced this when working in JB.\n\nShe later said that her boss wants to offer discount the next time I visit but with this kind of attitude and still expect me to return there again?

When I arrived at the shop, she kept asking if an hour was fine. I had no issue with that, as maybe they wanted to close the shop, but I hoped they had informed me earlier. The massage started nicely, and the masseuse was indeed friendly, but she stopped after 50 minutes. I had to explain to her multiple times, in English, that it should be an hour, and she finally understood. I hope that if the shop wants to close early, they inform customers earlier so that we won't come at all."

Was told to just go to room on 3rd floor with no guidance and low lighting. At room, you just need to change and get ready whilst waiting for masseur. When leaving, go down yourself and receptionist did not even acknowledge. (Deduct 1-star because of that)\n\nOn the other hand, masseur (didn‚Äôt ask her name) was really good. Ask about room temperature and her pressure throughout the session. Focused on the areas I was tight with. Several times during the session nearly dozed off even though the massage pressure was firm. At the end, even offered a hot drink.\n\nOverall ambience was good. Old wooden buildings have more charm but wooden furniture will creak with food steps on the wooden floor as well as opening/closing doors. Maybe I was the only one but it was quiet and calm I.e. relaxing.\n\nRoom did not have a shower but at the floor level there was a shower room and toilet."

Spent $66 for an hour of back massage and I specifically asked for more pressure, but the masseuse immediately refused, saying, \"Let's not, I don't want to injure you.\" Instead of an actual massage, I was left with what felt like a light caress over my entire body‚Äîcompletely ineffective and not at all what I paid for.\n\nTo make things worse, she even asked me which areas hurt the most, and I clearly mentioned my neck and back. Yet, she completely ignored my request and barely focused on those areas at all. What was the point of asking if she wasn‚Äôt going to listen?\n\nThe most disturbing part was that her touch felt unprofessional and extremely uncomfortable‚Äîalmost like I was being molested rather than receiving a massage. I‚Äôve never felt so uneasy during a session before, and I just wanted it to end as soon as possible.\n\nExtremely disappointing, uncomfortable, and unprofessional. Would not recommend."

  "text": "Nestled in the cozy cul-de-sac on Shelford Road, the Great Shelford Tree is more than just a solitary tree; it‚Äôs an enchanting landmark and a celebrated tourist attraction that holds the power to transform your perspective and inspire profound reflection. This hidden gem, while seemingly simple, is a breathtaking reminder of nature‚Äôs beauty and resilience, standing tall against the backdrop of suburban life.\n\nAs you approach, the ambiance shifts. The gentle rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of birds create a serene soundtrack that invites you to pause and breathe deeply. The tree, with its sprawling branches and lush green canopy, forms a natural cathedral, beckoning visitors to experience its tranquility. I vividly remember my first visit on a sunny afternoon; the light filtered through the leaves, casting intricate patterns on the ground, making it feel almost magical.\n\nWhat truly sets the Great Shelford Tree apart is its history. Local lore suggests that this tree has stood for over a century, witnessing the ebb and flow of life around it. Generations of families have gathered beneath its branches for picnics, storytelling, and even proposals. I spoke to a local elder who fondly recounted how, as a child, he would climb its sturdy limbs, feeling like a king surveying his kingdom. It‚Äôs clear this tree has served as a silent witness to countless life events, each one adding to its mystique.\n\nVisitors often come not just for the beauty, but for the personal connections they forge with this magnificent tree. I‚Äôve seen people leave behind tokens‚Äîa painted rock, a love note, or a small memento‚Äîeach representing a moment of joy or a wish for the future. On my second visit, I joined a group of artists for a plein air painting session. The atmosphere was electric, filled with laughter and creativity as we each attempted to capture the tree‚Äôs essence. As I painted, I felt a connection to those who had come before me, each brushstroke a tribute to the tree‚Äôs enduring legacy.\n\nThe Great Shelford Tree also serves as a hub for the community. Throughout the year, various events take place around this majestic tree‚Äîseasonal festivals, quaint gatherings, and meditation sessions. The camaraderie is palpable as friends connect over their love for this natural wonder.\n\nOne of the most poignant aspects of the Great Shelford Tree is its capacity for reflection. Standing beneath its vast canopy, I often contemplate my life journey. In a world that feels overwhelming, this tree offers grounding and peace. It has become a personal sanctuary where I can escape the hustle and bustle of daily life.\n\nFor those seeking inspiration, solace, or a simple moment of connection with nature, the Great Shelford Tree is an essential stop. It‚Äôs not just a tourist attraction; it‚Äôs a life-changing experience that encourages you to slow down, appreciate the beauty around you, and forge connections‚Äîwith both nature and those around you.\n\nIf you find yourself in the vicinity, I urge you to pay a visit. Bring a journal, a sketchbook, or simply your thoughts. You may leave with a renewed sense of purpose or just a smile, knowing you‚Äôve encountered something truly special. The Great Shelford Tree isn‚Äôt just a tree; it‚Äôs a monument to life itself, waiting to share its wisdom with anyone willing to listen."

Rumour has it that if you stood under this majestic tree from the Alexicus Shelfordae species, you‚Äôd be able to smell traces of Nasi Lemak and Truffle for some strange reason. I decided to pay a visit to this tree and lo and behold, the fragrance of Nasi lemak wafted into my nostrils and I fell onto my knees in reverence and started praying.\n\nI received 16 business deal that very same week.\n\n100/10 would recommend if you need extra luck to kena TOTO.

  "text": "Been a good customer for more 2 years and easily spent close to $2,500 minimum.Encountered a few times rude indifferent attitudes over the years from some maintenance staff but this time enough is enough. Century Square 19 June 2025-2130-2245hrs = Coin changing machine not working, cash exchange machine waited 30 mins upon frequent request to fix ignored. After playing one of the toy push displacement machine for an hour, managed to win the red stopper prize. I alerted this Indian maintenance staff (photo-without glasses, light facial stubble, stout built, 5'6\") several times at close range but he deliberately ignored me until I walked right up to him to respond. He snapped back in a hostile manner and replied \" WHAT ?!!\" I calmly told him I won the prize to collect and was shocked he angrily retorted, \" So, shake for it!\". I then firmly repeated to collect my prize. He then went to reset the machine and pass me the prize from the counter. I then calmly requested for his name for reference but again he ignored me. I insisted he provide his name and added that if he felt his hostile attitude was justified, why would he be reluctant to own up to his uncouth behavior. He then challenged me to go report on Facebook when I requested for his name again. He snapped back and instructed I just identify him as \"the Indian guy\". I informed him that there were more than few Indian staff there so his name was required. He then ignored me again. I then calmly snapped a facial photo of him for reference and he turned hostile questioning me several times why I took his photo. I simply smiled and replied, \" So?.. It's for your management.\" I firmly stood my ground and paused for his possible retaliation. I definitely wouldn't have had hesitated to call the police had he dared made further threatening movements towards me.\nAnyways, my 2 cents.. If any of your staff is unhappy working there, please tell them, like what locals say,  to stay home, shake legs, and don't work to avoid antagonizing good paying customers without cause. As for myself, I'm pretty done tolerating all your bad staff behavior and probably no longer patronize your franchise once I clear my balance tokens, since, from so many bad reviews, nothing seems to be rectified. Last year before closing hours, my bad, I left my pouch with cash filled, Credit cards, ID,.. Etc. wallet overnight at your machine and even calling the 1st  morning maintenance staff on opening hours to check. He kept informing nothing found and kept brushing off my concerns claiming very busy. Nevertheless, I personally rushed down to your CS branch to confirm with that Chinese morning staff and I even offered $100 reward to view the cctv. He refused but I demanded to view the cctv to trace the point of my own negligence or I'll call the police. He relented. Once it was clear the cctv showed the night staff found it, that morning staff miraculously revealed that my bag suddenly appeared and was found and placed under the cash register. It was not there before. I still kept my integrity and gave him the$100 reward to share with the honest Malay night staff , despite knowing I could have easily called the police on his intentions to keep my bag after viewing the cctv. So much for your staff professionalism. Do better."

  "text": "I went to the Century Square outlet on 20th May at 1915 hrs. I saw the Avengers machines both with lights on and no tape, so I decided to play and draw 50 tokens out.\n\nHowever, the machine rejected all my tokens, and when I asked the staff for assistance, he said the machine was spoilt and BOTH machines couldn't be played. But there was no indications or signs that said the machine was unable to play. He just smiles and nods in agreement?!?! Is it so hard to put the black tap on?\n\nI then went to the counter to request a refund, since there wasn't any other machine I would like to play. And the counter staff said no refunds for token.\n\nBut in the first place, I wouldn't have redrawn the token if the machine showed that it was unavailable. There was no tape, and the lights and wheels were spinning.\n\nWhy did your staff's negligence in doing their job cause me to need to bring home 50 tokens? Super upset hearing upon this, and your staff weren't exactly friendly either. Should i be thankful i only drawn 50 tokens out.\n\nSuper bad experience in this outlet, and its not the first time! please do something about it. It is not fair for your customers too."

The moment she realised I wasn‚Äôt planning to make a purchase on the spot, her attitude completely changed. She became impatient, dismissive, and clearly didn‚Äôt want to entertain any of my questions. It felt like she was just giving me half-hearted replies to brush me off.\n\nWhat made it worse was the way she looked down on me as if I wasn‚Äôt worth her time just because I wasn‚Äôt buying anything. The lack of basic courtesy and respect was really disappointing and uncalled for.\n\nEven if someone isn‚Äôt making a purchase immediately, they are still a customer and should be treated with professionalism. I won‚Äôt be returning, and I‚Äôll be advising others to avoid this branch as well."

When asked, they say cos the students got appointments. If this is the case, you should not do walk in patients, just do appointments. Terrible clinic and i have to cancel my registration after waiting for 45mins.

It is usually very busy in the morning, so I came in the afternoon and thankfully I didnt have to wait long, which i appreciate. The main doctor is very professional and approachable as well. Sometimes there are locum doctors, and they are also nice. Sorry i cant remember all of them since im not always sick and visiting.. I had been seen by Dr Li who listened to my concerns and made me feel comfortable asking questions. The reception staff are also willing to patiently explain things about my CHAS entitlement and that really helped. The clinic itself is also clean and well maintained. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a reliable and caring healthcare provider (:"

But her response really shocked me.\n\nShe turned her head in a dramatic slow-mo, rolled her eyes at me as she said ‚Äúhuhhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Ä¶..?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been around for so long already, you didn‚Äôt hear before meh?‚Äù She said so much yet she could not tell me exactly which year was the brand founded.\n\nSo she was rude and judgmental towards me when I have not heard of the brand, yet she herself as a promoter of Tillamook, don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs founded?\n\nIsn‚Äôt the point of being a promoter, to promote and share more about the brand to customers? What‚Äôs the point of hiring one when the promoter was so judgemental yet clueless about the brand?\n\nI‚Äôm sure the reason why she‚Äôs even hired to promote at the temporary booth at CS is because the brand is unpopular and they want to make it known to CS customers, so it‚Äôs not surprising that I haven‚Äôt heard of the brand.\n\nThis encounter with the female promoter really ruined my shopping experience at CS. I‚Äôd rather patronise Fairprice Finest in future.\n\nEdit: Just to add that I‚Äôve sent a feedback to CS via email and their response felt really templated and insincere. I‚Äôm just disappointed."

At the cooked roast meat deli counter, the service staff often disappear from the counter, patrons have to look for them. On Sunday (6 Apr), I bought a BBQ honey-glazed chicken, the Indian lady staff simply packed the chicken and dumped the package on the counter top... without a word and eye-contact. In the past, the service staff would greet the customers cheerfully, hand the package over with both hands, and thank them for the purchase!"

We were placed right at the entrance, 13 of us in total and we open three bottle. Can't even have a full standing table.\n\nAfter clearing all our drinks to one side, nobody else was using the cleared side table, not even the tables besides us. All were left empty. Since there is nobody using it why is there a need to force all 13 of us to stand to only one side? 3 bottles of gin that we open is still not enough??\n\nThen at around 2a.m, staff were clearing our drinks away from the table already. We werent even finish drinking. When we came back from the dance floor, more than half of our drinks were cleared. It's like they are trying to rush us off. We don't feel welcomed.\n\nI don't recommend going this place. please spend somewhere else. We are the table right at the entrance to the club. Frustrating."

The serviceman was able to give a good and proper diagnosis of the issues immediately. Diagnosis was better than what the authorised Google service centre gave which suggested that it was a motherboard issue and to replace the screen and motherboard which turned out to be incorrect. The serviceman just suggested a screen replacement only which is a lot better because my data would not be affected. He was also able to give satisfactory answers to all of my queries.\n\nPleasantly surprised that the shop actually has the replacement for such an older phone model. Repair was really quick and the phone was ready for collection the next day. My data was preserved and the phone is working as good as new!\n\nPrice of the repair was around half of what the Google service centre quoted."

I asked her why is she so impatient and she didn‚Äôt change afterwards. After taking my temperature, she said I had high fever and ask if I could take buprofen. I didn‚Äôt recognized this medicine name and told her I don‚Äôt know and she immediately throw me the face of discrimination.

  "text": "Zero stars.. This is hands down one of the most frustrating and painful service experiences I‚Äôve had. I brought in a Samsung device for what should have been a straightforward power button repair. I was first quoted around $200, then later received a text saying that the cost had increased to over $400‚Äîwith no proper explanation.\n\nWhen I finally received a call, I was told the technician had now found the touchscreen to be ‚Äúfaulty.‚Äù How convenient‚Äîthis issue only appeared after they disassembled the device. I was then told they couldn‚Äôt perform a partial repair just for the power button, so I‚Äôd have to pay for the screen as well.\n\nOver the phone, I specifically asked multiple times if my device would be returned in the same condition if I didn‚Äôt proceed and the person acknowledged that it would, and I made my expectations very clear. Even before sending it in, I made this expectation known‚Äîbut now, of course, no one will admit to it.\n\nWhen I didn‚Äôt proceed with the repair and came to collect my device, I checked and had to ask them to charge and demonstrate it‚Äîand that‚Äôs when it was revealed the screen wasn‚Äôt even showing the charging indicator anymore.\n\nHere‚Äôs the worst part‚Äîwhen they tried to justify it, they told me that fixing the button would ‚Äúunavoidably‚Äù damage the touchscreen, meaning I‚Äôd be forced to pay for both. If that was the case, WHY wasn‚Äôt it disclosed upfront? Why quote one thing, then hold my device hostage with unexpected, unexplained charges?\n\nZero transparency. No accountability. The responses felt scripted, and the way things were handled left me, the customer, feeling like I was somehow at fault for not asking the ‚Äúright‚Äù questions‚Äîwhen I had, multiple times. Save yourself the trouble. Don‚Äôt send your device here unless you‚Äôre ready to be overcharged, misled, and left angry and helpless."

After that, I brought the tablet to a regular repair shop and had it fixed for only SGD 80. The technician there confirmed that there was no issue with the screen or frame at all.\n\nI feel disappointed that the service center‚Äôs. As a customer, I expect transparency, fair pricing, and honest assessments since its a Samsung service centre. I hope Samsung can improve the quality and integrity of their service at this branch."

All I wanted was to replace a screen protector (since they have the ridiculous requirement that I can't replace the screen protector myself without voiding my warranty). But they insisted on also performing some sort of device scan, even though I did not come in for anything related to software. Perhaps you think this is just a pleasant add-on service to check for your device health - but it's *mandatory*. You can't refuse. No matter how you protest, the staff insist that they scan your device because they replaced your screen protector. We have absolutely no idea what they're doing with your personal data.\n\nBy the way, have you read the terms and conditions? You have to promise that if they damage your data, that's entirely on you, they take no responsibility.\n\nCustomers clearly aren't important to Samsung. Only money is."

  "text": "SkyHelix Sentosa Review: A Decent Experience, But Not for Thrill-Seekers\n\nWe visited SkyHelix Sentosa in the morning, hoping for something fun or unique, but left feeling a bit underwhelmed.\n\nThe experience involves sitting in a parachute-like open-air gondola that slowly ascends into the sky and gently rotates to offer a 360¬∞ view of Sentosa. It lasts about 10-15 minutes. During that time, an instructor gives a short introduction and tries to entertain the group, which was nice, but there‚Äôs only so much you can do in that span, especially when the ride itself is very passive.\n\nThis is not a ride or anything adventurous. There‚Äôs no adrenaline rush, no surprises, just a slow ascent, a calm view, and a slow descent. The view in the morning was okay, but not particularly spectacular. Maybe a sunset or night session would be better for photography or ambiance.\n\nThat said, this attraction is suitable for people who aren‚Äôt into adventure or thrill rides and are just looking for a mild, scenic experience. It's peaceful and easy, making it ideal for families with young kids or older folks who want a simple, elevated view of the island.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a decent, short activity, but if you're someone looking for excitement, SkyHelix probably won't deliver that."

It was not a nail but just a micro hole in the middle of the tire . He used both the wet and dry method to spot the micro hole . He is really an expert in the field of wheels and told him more about wheels . This owner is really awesome and all hands up to your experience. Superb service and humble workshop"

Surprised that it's manned by an old couple. Uncle is very fast and experienced and removed & patched the tyre in no time. Aunty will help Uncle to keep the equipments after he was finished with them. Aunty also guided my car to reverse out when I drive off. Very nice and sweet couple. Not a lot of workshops opened so early. Will definitely introduce my friends to patronize them in times of emergency."
