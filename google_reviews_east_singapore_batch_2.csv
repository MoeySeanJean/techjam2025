And surprisingly, most stalls don't partner with food delivery platforms.

The zi char, rojak, bak chor mee, prawn noodles, satay, western food, Indian Muslim food and economy rice stalls are all good! The drink stall also sells hot pastries that are pretty yummy.

The zi char is tasty and value for money. One regular portion is more than enough for 2 people. Expect a queue during peak hours, however you won't need to wait too long. Our fave is the fish head curry and Mongolian chicken.

The rojak is so delicious, an uncle said he would come all the way from Jurong for it! And I agree, it's the best rojak I've tasted in Singapore so far.

Also recommend to try the homemade longan peach gum cold drink from the drinks stall.

Definitely a must-visit if you're in Sengkang!

She provided a one-for-one replacement of the product from a newer batch thereafter and promised to take up the issue with the vendor to inform them of the lapse.

All these years, the cashiers here in general are very patient and full of care, and the operations staff will always be there to lend a helping hand, although it is a shame that I've seen some aunties and uncles running their shady home based food biz, when they see them taking their meal breaks will take advantage and ask them for help with physically demanding tasks, literally.

Beef bourguigon is also very good unfortunately it's portion too small and not enough to douse our sourdough.

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to share my recent experience during a medical check-up at True Clinic PLQ (before 10 am). Overall, I found the staff to be friendly and professional in addressing my queries. However, there are a few areas that I believe require attention and improvement.

Firstly, the room where I underwent my ECG felt more like a storeroom—cramped and lacking air conditioning. The ambiance was far from what one would expect at a medical facility. I would strongly recommend that True Clinic reevaluate its facilities to ensure a more comfortable and suitable environment for patients.

Secondly, the reception area and room conditions need significant improvement. The presence of air conditioning is essential for patient comfort during procedures, especially in such a compact space.

Lastly, it would be beneficial to provide additional training for the staff on the usage of ECG equipment. My initial interaction with the staff member who administered the ECG indicated a lack of familiarity with the device, which caused some discomfort and uncertainty.

Considering the amount paid for the check-up, patients naturally expect a higher standard of service. I genuinely hope that with this feedback, True Clinic can review its operational practices and make the necessary enhancements to provide a better patient experience.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.",en,6 months ago,2025-02-18T08:26:43.930265Z,Ferhan Feroze

On top of that, I had already received a letter from LTA instructing me to install the new version of the IU. Unfortunately, when I checked with VICOM and other shops, most were fully booked until next month.

Thankfully, I came across Hock Wah Motor Workshop, and I’m so glad I did! I explained my situation, and they immediately offered assistance, letting me drive through their shop for a same-day IU installation.

Their service was top-notch. I dropped off the technician, and one of their friendly (and chiobu!) staff helped me with the details, including how I wanted the new IU placed and where to position the cashcard slot. Everyone was incredibly patient, answering all my questions without any rush.

Best of all, I was able to collect my car on the same day, and they even took the time to explain how to use the new IU properly.

Highly recommended if you're looking for fast, friendly, and professional service. I'm already considering going back to them for regular car servicing and other vehicle needs.

Although the product selection is not extensive, I can usually find the essentials.

However, there are some issues that should be addressed:
•	Quality control
The chicken, especially the ones on sale, often have an unpleasant smell.
Some fruits and vegetables are moldy. (For example, the cucumbers sold yesterday as “1 for 1” had to be thrown away due to mold. Cucumbers are high in moisture and thus carry a higher risk.)
Packaged items in particular seem more prone to mold.
•	Frequent stockouts
Some essential items are often out of stock.

I especially hope that quality control will be improved.
Assuming that customers will just return bad products is not a good approach.",en,a month ago,2025-07-26T00:52:36.697430254Z,aki Hiro

I visited this store around 11:45AM today. After fetching all the items I needed, I was waiting for my turn at the self-checkout counter. I noticed the lady at the regular counter started staring at my shopping basket. She also had a couple of customers waiting on her for billing. When my turn came, I moved to the self-checkout counter and started scanning the items. She then turned around towards me and peeked into my basket a couple of times. Then she asked me to leave the self-checkout counter and come to her regular counter. Only then did I realize what was going on. I asked her again to repeat what she said. This time she said that her counter was free and she wanted me to leave the self-checkout counter and get the items through her. There were 2 other customers at the self-checkout counters who she never bothered to check or never asked them to move to her counter. The same lady was standing next to me in the aisles, for no particular reason. I only realized when all this had happened. I was fuming inside with anger and was really annoyed, instead of arguing, I had to leave the stuff mid way at the self checkout counter and leave the store.

1. If you feel people are stealing stuff from your store, remove the self-checkout counters. Don't profile customers and selectively humiliate them.

2. Learn from the other big supermarket chain in the same area. They removed the self-checkout counters. They do not go around profiling people.

3. Provide proper training for your folks in the store. This is not the first bad rating for this particular store.",en,2 years ago,2023-08-27T08:57:56.831501Z,Pdp

When I bought things, she did not see.

Very strong leadership to “supervise “ her team of workers. Very suitable for this job to scrutinise her customers like a hawk.

The boss of the ONE supermarket is very fortunate to hire such candidate.

Every review has to be positive otherwise Blk 201 branch manager’s esteem can be affected.
Please give good feedback to support her ego.
Maybe she is an indispensable manager in the chain.

It was built in 1930s on the former site of the demolished Fort Tanjong Katong. Katong Park originally faced the sea. It lost its seafront during East Coast land reclamation in 1966.
Katong Park is a small quiet park that has a beautiful Mindanao Gum Heritage Tree native to Papua New Guinea.
The remnants of the old Fort Tanjong Katong sat on a side of the park that is all fenced up to safeguard the remaining delicate artifacts.
There is a public toilet beside the fenced up historical artifacts, and a children playground around the park. Benches are strategically located. Besides the children playground, there is an exercise corner as well.
Over at the Southern end of the Park is a dog run.
Katong Park is connected to East Coast Park through a nearby Underpass.
A bit of history here: A bomb exploded on September 1963 in this Park. It marked the beginning of Kronfrontasi with Indonesia. Sukarno led Indonesia opposed to the formation of Malaysia, which until 1965, Singapore is part of it.",en,a year ago,2024-05-08T08:53:31.167662Z,Forest BK

An old school kopi-tiam that sits at the corner of a terrace shop houses. Likely a go-to spot for the neighbouring business and residents.  Liked the small eclectic mix of stalls. Tried the wanton noodle, and it's the traditional type. Noodle is QQ, decently spiced chilli, and home-cook char siew. Pretty value for money for its location.

The kopi o kosong is strong, and burnt well. The way I like it. The drink stall also sells fresh baked buns and puffs, baked with happy Uncle Wong, with long experience as a baker, restaurant owner and a colourful history to boot! Love the fresh old style sugar sprinkled doughnuts, their version of ham-chim-peng, custard puff and sausage bun.

Economic rice is decently good and value for money. Home taste type, the dishes are not strongly flavoured.

Supposedly the toast bread and half-boiled eggs are good. Will try that next. Update: Toast is yums! Although not the charcoal type but electric toasted. The sifu got the kungfu to make a savory kaya-rich crispy toast! Half boiled eggs is of the right consistency to rival those from the more established Singapore brands!

Black coffee tasted strong, more sour, smells good.
Mocha tasted smooth with a slightly sweet, velvety chocolate.
Pizza was delicious, crunchy crust.

They also sell tote bag, soap from recycled coffee, and I saw a booklet about this camping ground on the shelf. I heard they can give you training about coffee. You can check on their activities at their insta. Interesting!",en,2 months ago,2025-06-03T14:04:34.509610Z,OH Wendy

No, NTUC/Fairprice/The Bar,  it is still a champagne flute you are using. Not a Magnum flute, not a Balthazar flute if there ever were such glasses.  Doing a half pour is a laughable shortchange.

I wanted to get a cup noodle. Small $1.75 and big $1.85. I would usually just get the small one but I saw a promo 2 for $2.95 for the big ones. It’s a no brainer I get them as this is what promo is for. But the self check out counter registered $3.70 and luckily I saw and asked the cashier.  She went to the aisle to check and asked if it’s the wrong brand wrong dates… Nope they added up. Then she brought the 2 cup noodles to another cashier colleague to key in and the same thing happened and all this while they keep saying it’s the wrong price. Meaning their system is correct and mine is wrong despite the label. I had a similar incident a couple of years back in Canada and the cashier ‘cheerfully’ gave me the item for free. I am not after a free item. But it is sad that our working force is so rigid and failed to want to see from a customer point of view. The tag is there, the dates are correct. Someone forgot to key in the system. So why are you telling us your issue? We like to employ aunties and uncles to the front end job. Don’t get me wrong. I am an uncle myself now. But what I feel is that the management of Giant need to have a renewed thinking and maybe it’s time they let the young people take over as there is a saying in Chinese if the top is ‘uncle’ the bottom also think like ‘uncles’.",en,11 months ago,2024-09-28T08:30:27.417079Z,Jason Sim

•	Affordable – One of the cheapest options in Singapore.
•	Free breakfast – Basic (just bread and tea/coffee), but a nice perk.
•	Facilities – Has a fridge for guests to use.
•	Convenient location – Close to a FairPrice grocery store, a hawker center, laundry services, and a night market.

Cons
•	WiFi issues – You have to reconnect every day, and the process is very tedious. If you have multiple devices, you’ll need to do it for each one.
•	No extra amenities – No towels provided, and you have to make your own bed.
•	Lack of social atmosphere – Not many events or opportunities to meet people.
•	Cramped facilities – The bathrooms are tiny, with the shower and toilet in the same stall, so the floor is always wet.
•	Poor bathroom conditions – No toiletries provided; the soap dispenser was filled with water, and there were no paper towels.
•	Inconvenient location – About 45 minutes from most major attractions by public transportation.
•	Noisy at night – Quiet hours are not enforced. In my experience, a guest in the women’s dorm ate strong-smelling food and talked loudly on the phone in the bathroom, and the staff didn’t intervene.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-19T07:23:02.555261Z,Shani Levi

Over a month ago, I encountered a rude cashier who displayed unprofessional behavior that left a negative impression.

During our visit, the cashier aggressively shoved the promotion panel, almost hitting my wife's face. Additionally, this cashier instructed my helper to pack our items into a plastic bag and reprimanded my helper harshly for not doing it correctly. This level of disrespect is unacceptable and made our shopping experience very uncomfortable. 不要狗眼看人低！

I was informed that the manager on duty would call me the next day to address the situation, but the call only came more than a month later. This delay left our family wondering about the service recovery standards at Sheng Siong.

They only update what they did to the staff like warning letter etc however leaving you fuming mad customer in lurch for a month, I believe the service standards fails the promise corporate vision.

The lucky store has everything you can think of and if they don't have it they can preorder it for you. Which is really good customer service.

Personally, I bought some home appliances plus a Garmin watch to finish up my vouchers and I was very happy with the store and it's products. For anyone who is curious they sell fans, speakers, headsets, rice cookers, microwaves, thermal bottles, shavers and ovens and more.

The whole procedure was extremely disappointing since I wasn’t given a proper check up to why I had a cough and the doctor kept assuming that I had Covid. If I suspected I have Covid, I can just do the ART myself at home! The medicine also looked very generic, unlikely to be specific to my case. I would warn all who wish to visit this clinic that they will likely be subject to an ART test regardless of how your cough / fever / flu / sore throat happened.

You won't miss it because of the huge name imprinted at the side and front of the building. It is beside the main road so it easily accessible by vehicles like taxi and buses. At night it is rather quiet and peaceful away from the usual bustling. The nearest train station aljunied mrt is about 500 metres away a 7 minutes walk. Around the area you have access to coffeeshops and different eateries and the famous no sign board restaurant. Convenience store is located at the next lane which is lorong 24. It is a petrol kiosk which has atm booth as well. G spa is also located nearby which provides professional but expensive massage. The hotel is very well lit. Very bright and warm welcoming hallways. The reception is small but nice. Rooms are rather squeezy but depends on individual needs overall cozy.

Was really looking forward to the massage. However, am very disappointed by the level of service and nonchalance. Front desk had told therapist i am in with voucher and the duration. For some reason, the therapist mistook my session as 2 hours. After 90 minutes, she told me she mistook I was the 2 hour customer and that her actual 2 hour customer was here. She had worked on my shoulders both sides and only right lower back. She also said that since she had done extra 30 minutes I need to pay her for it. Honestly, in a body massage, half dozing and with no watch I have no concept of the time that had passed and did not know it had been 90 minutes already. I did pay the extra 30 minutes which cost me more than the 60 minutes voucher. Think there several issues here 1) front desk knows the duration of every customer booked - and with they should have come in to inform therapist therapist 2) I did not ask for the extra 30 minutes which was a mistake - to make matters worse I went out feeling unbalanced since my left lower back had not been worked on. 3) the session ended really abruptly with therapist telling me she had to go to next customer, pay for her time and told me to change and leave. 4) there was no acknowledgment or apology for the mistake that was made.

The food looks good but tastes...well... I tried the seafood stew. It was bitter and strange. My friend tried the pasta which was average and a bit sweeter than normal. Sweet potato fries were average, not soggy. A coke costs $6.

There were lots of cartons of drinks stacked up in the store, leaving only a 30cm wide space for customers to walk in and reach for their drinks in the fridges. When I was slowly getting out after getting my drink from one of the fridge some cartons toppled down, barely missing my feet and the cashier shouted ""What!"". Mind you, my hands were full - I was holding my laptop and a bag filled with things. I tried arranging some of the cartons but they were too heavy for me to stack it back up so I left it there and walked over to pay. This cashier proceeded to leave her counter and started slowly arranging back the cartons, all while murmuring a string of words in Indian- presumably cursing at me. After taking around 1 to 2 minutes to arrange 5 toppled cartons, she finally walked back to the counter and said ""Give me"" and reached out for my drink to scan. I am very much displeased and disappointed with the lack of service and rude attitude of the cashier. I hope the management takes action seriously.

Brought a friend there after seeing the good reviews here. All the good things about the atmosphere became irrelevant when the masseuse Wendy, who attended to my foreign friend, kept asking insensitive personal questions and giving unwanted remarks, making my friend uncomfortable and unhappy at the same time. The one hour supposedly relaxing session became an horrifying “interrogation”. Wendy even asked for my friend’s contact number which was promptly refused. I understand chatting during the session was to build rapport with the customer but talking about a person’s personal life might be a bit overboard unless the person is willing to share. On top of that, the actual massage session wasn’t good as Wendy seemed to just go through motion and she openly chatted on her phone during the session. Even though my experience with masseuse May was good, but the overall experience was ruined because of that. I was embarrassed as I was the one who persuaded my friend to come here. We decided that this would be our first and last time here.",en,9 months ago,2024-11-24T04:17:10.741573Z,KiNG

The massage flow was not well-planned and executed. Therapist did not ask what issue(s) do I have/would like to address, or any past injury/surgery history. Therapist tried to loosen/stretch my tight back muscles, and upon discovering it was impossible using hands/forearms, therapist began stepping on my back without prior informing. During the stepping process, therapist did not ask if the pressure is ok (too light/too heavy). While briefly pressing onto my calves, therapist did not notice that I have varicose veins (静脉曲张) and exerted force that made it very uncomfortable. Therapist was also unable to identify varicose veins and mentioned it as bruises.

Overall, it felt like a rush job, not putting any care and thought in the entire massage session, leaving me feeling my areas of concerns not addressed.

Hanip was really helpful to help arrange for towing and resolved the issue the next day at a very reasonable price.

Hanip is knowledgeable with Toyota cars and also honest in his business dealing. Only would change and recommend parts that needs to be replaced.

By far the best mechanic I have encountered. Highly recommended.",en,10 months ago,2024-10-25T07:38:58.165329Z,Lewis Tan

Last month, I went there with my friend (2 pax).

We reached at 8 PM, and they didn’t tell us they had no girls. Once the beer tower was in front of us, they then told us that most girls were not here yet and that we would have to wait. They only had a few, and they were not up to standard.

My friend ordered one girl, and we waited until 9 PM, but still no girls came. We billed and decided to go to Leos. We paid for the beer tower and food, which was around $180, and my friend settled the tip of $100 for the girl.

After the girl left, the manager, Aloy, immediately blocked the door and requested a tip. He demanded $170. In the end, my friend settled with him at $150, and we went to another place happy.

This is the first time I have written a one-star review in my life, and even after a month, I still feel unhappy. I also run a business in SG and understand the importance of reputation. However, it’s wrong to block the door and demand a so-called papasan tip when we only sat there for around 40 minutes, without much service, and were unhappy when we left.

We go to night spots to enjoy ourselves, not to be forced to pay a tip when there is no service at all. The worst part was the manager and two waiters blocking the door and refusing to let us go.",en,a year ago,2024-05-29T05:09:38.309785Z,Peter Chan

I went for a bowl of fish soup noodles from Chai's Original Sliced Fish Soup stall. The stall owner was super friendly and happy to answer my questions. She also checked with me if I wanted to add evaporated milk to my soup and if I could accept bitter gourd before replacing it with vegetables, which I thought was a nice touch.

What I really appreciated was that the soup tasted great and didn’t leave that thirsty aftertaste, showing the owner’s focus on healthier choices. The food court has quite a variety of stalls, but I naturally went for the sliced fish soup—it’s always my top pick whenever I eat at a food court.

I also had a bowl of mango sago dessert that looked really colourful, but unfortunately, the green sago was quite hard and spoiled the overall taste. It looked promising, but I didn’t find it particularly fantastic.

$0.10 EXTRA for every fruits cut. Asked for the service charges stating of cutting of fruits which the aunt said it's not stated. Then how can such services be charged when not stated?

Should seek advise with NEA about dirty hands for food handlers and CASE regarding the UNETHICAL ACTIONS by not displaying the costs for services.

Although I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine—I absentmindedly left the shop without paying for a bottle of mineral water—I was quite taken aback by the way the situation was handled by one of your staff members.

That morning, I must have been distracted and did not realize I had walked out with the item unpaid. As I was leaving, I heard someone repeatedly saying “hello,” and when I turned around, I realized it was a staff member calling after me. She immediately said, in a loud and accusatory tone, “Hello, why did you take the water without even paying?” It was only at that moment that I realized my error and sincerely apologized, explaining that it was an honest oversight.

I also said, “Do you think I would intentionally steal something worth $1.30?” Her response was, “I called you hello, hello, but you didn’t respond. My name is not ‘hello,’” and she went on to say how tiring it was to catch up to me—even though I was only a few steps away from the shop.

What truly made me uncomfortable was the manner in which the situation was handled. The staff member spoke loudly in front of other customers, which caused me considerable embarrassment. A more appropriate and professional approach might have been to calmly approach me and say, “Ma’am, I believe you forgot to pay for the water,” rather than publicly accusing me.

I understand and respect the importance of loss prevention, but I believe such matters should be addressed with professionalism, respect, and proper customer service. I hope you take this feedback constructively, as I trust this is not the standard of service your establishment aims to provide.",en,a month ago,2025-07-28T03:32:58.406409828Z,Gemini Gemini

When I arrived, I mentioned that I had to leave by a certain time, and they were kind enough to accommodate. The mechanic spotted some other wear and tear on some parts during the checks and asked if I wanted to get those parts replaced. I went ahead with the urgent ones and left the non-urgent ones for next time, as I was in a hurry.

7500 Beach Road, Singapore 199591

🟠  My husband and I visited ""Club 5"" at PARKROYAL on Beach Road on May 1st, 2025, and had a delightful experience. ▪︎As we stepped into the bar lounge, we were drawn to the vibrant ambience & stylish decor.

🔵 Description of the decor
*******************************
🟨 Club 5 exudes an elegant yet contemporary charm.▪︎The space features warm ambient lighting from gold-accented ceiling fixtures that cast a soft glow across the room. 🩶 Plush velvet seating in deep, rich tones adds comfort and style, while the geometric-patterned flooring & mirrored accents contribute a touch of glamour.

● The bar area is illuminated & framed by arched wooden shelves displaying an array of spirits and liquor. 🔷️ Overall, the decor is upscale and atmospheric.

🟩  We only ordered 2 Hot Cafe Lattes, as we just had dinner at Ginger, the restaurant next door. The lady bartender was attentive and friendly. ● When I requested her to customise my Cafe Latte with more milk, she acceded to my request happily. 🌿 Before we left, she asked my hubby if the coffees were okay. 🙏🏻 The Cafe Lattes were rich and creamy, thank you bartender for the kind hospitality:)

🟪  I flipped through the Club 5 Menu and saw it has an extensive and diverse range of bar snacks.

🟧 The live band at Club 5 was amazing, and the lead vocalist exceeded my expectations.▪︎ When I requested 'Too Sweet' by Hozier, they happily obliged, and the performance was awesome. ● The intimate setting and acoustic instrumentation added to the charm of the evening.

🌿🔵 Our first visit to Club 5 was a pleasant and happy one. The combination of great coffee and excellent service made for a memorable evening.

Called last Friday at 8.45am with the intention to book for OBU installation... not urgent so I am okay with August dates, but was told to call again on Monday because the bookings are fully booked & it opens every Monday.

Called today ( Monday ) at 9am, no one answered and waited on the line... but when the line finally went through, the person said it has fully booked?! Are we supposed to keep calling every Monday just for a slot ( not taking any advanced booking ), and they do not allow me to do a walk in.

I think she should tells us at least before putting new screen protector. It’s not cheap!!!

There have been many new additions since Kopitiam reopened after renovations in April 2025. I don’t visit the airport often, so I’ll be updating this review as I try more dishes from the various stalls.

Korean & Japanese Stall
I tried the Saba fish, which was uniquely paired with sambal chilli. I was pleasantly surprised by how well our local sambal complemented the grilled Saba—an unexpected but delicious twist. Loved it!

Mixed Vegetable Rice
This is one of the more popular stalls, and it consistently draws long queues. There’s a good variety to choose from, which is always a plus. I ordered the mala pork belly, salted egg chicken, stir-fried shredded melon, and Chinese pork sausage. The total came up to $15.40—definitely the most expensive mixed veg rice I’ve had so far. That said, the culinary execution here is, in my opinion, above industry standard. You can taste the difference in quality and care.",en,3 weeks ago,2025-08-07T03:48:57.948864910Z,WanderWithWit

I remember the only food court we could find in Changi Airport was the one in the basement, mainly existed for the staff. It was like a hidden secret for those who wanted to grab an affordable meal before flying or selling kidney so that they wouldn't starve during the trip.

It's great now we have many food court for public, and T3 is not exception. They are located in the basement 2, it opens 24 hour! And the signage is clear, no longer some kind of insider secret anymore.

The price is around or slightly more expensive than regular food court. Food price has increased significantly in Singapore everywhere. There are plenty of seats and that is great, too. The choices are okay, I think if you are not picky, you can always find something to eat.",en,6 months ago,2025-02-11T08:40:00.521565Z,Buren

At the time, it offered exactly what I needed — clean, comfortable, and affordable accommodation in a convenient location.

The room was small but well-maintained, with a comfortable bed, working air conditioning, and a private bathroom — all the essentials were covered. While the decor was simple and a bit dated even back then, everything was clean and functional. I appreciated the daily housekeeping and polite front desk service, which made the stay easy and stress-free.

The hotel was located in Geylang, which at the time was known for its food scene and nightlife. It might not have been the most touristy area, but it was safe, well-connected by public transport, and full of local flavor — especially if you're into street food. The MRT station was a short walk away, so getting to Orchard Road, Marina Bay, and other tourist spots was no problem.

For a budget hotel in 2009, this place delivered great value. It was perfect for a short stay, and I remember being impressed by how smooth everything was, considering the price I paid.

I tried various items over numerous days -

Nasi lemak wasn't that great. The rice was rather tasteless, lacking salt and lemak. Chilli was too sweet and lack certain spices in it. Chix wing was crispy but not marinated, almost tasteless., Ikan bills and some crispy stuff were good - 2/5

Pork/peitan porridge and Korean saba/chix  were quite acceptable and priced reasonably - 3.5/5

The laksa from this wonton noodles stall is unusual. Their laksa has no cockles but fried wanton. The gravy is flat and tasteless - 1/5

Vegetarian mee-hoon is acceptable. Various ingredients to choose from but their curry gravy isn't to my liking - 3/5

Chix rice was acceptable though slightly flat, but at least, got the chilli to make up for. Meat is tender and it cost $5.5 for two wings and inard with rice - 3/5

They only accept cash to keep cost down but u can draw from the DBS/POSB Atm just next door the Esso petrol station. Plenty of parking spaces to leave your car to fix.

Soon after this week, I had a strange pain on the left side of my head and eye area I went to visit the clinic again. This time round I met Dr Lee and after hearing my symptoms to my surprise he commented I am having suspected symptoms of shingles. That to me was really to my big surprise as I never would think of that and I don't show any shingles yet and how accurately he has diagnose me.

Things escalated when patient told the Chinese girl that he had insurance and the Malay lady just exploded in front of so many patients. My grandma told me at one point even the PRC patient was feeling uneasy at their conversation and wants to give up on using the insurance.

This is not the first time your staff had exploded on the Chinese colleague. About 2 months ago, the yesterday Malay girl and another Malay girl bigger in size also exploded on the Chinese girl in front of all customers. Is this really appropriate to do that in front of everyone, what kind of customer service experience are you all giving the patients? Its no wonder I don't see Chinese front desk a lot of times, most of the time are Malay staff, its no wonder not many Chinese wants to work in this clinic, your Malay staff is too explosive and not respecting fellow colleagues.

Please do something about it or I will relate this to MOH about what I see. This is unacceptable",en,3 weeks ago,2025-08-07T02:44:02.539112813Z,fiona angela

I was suffering for a good 3 days before i went to see Dr Tan at Trucare Medical, Hougang and was detected as having ear fungal infection. The pocket was very deep in and unfortunately the fungi was not really removed even after the doctor attempted ear syringing. Unknown to me i had bouts of discomfort returning  the following week and when i called the clinic multiple times, i was refused to speak with the doctor by the Malay receptionist. She was extremely rude as if the world owed her a living. Finally this mid week i managed to get through Dr Tan who advised me to use the ear drops again and see him for a follow up. He was very kind, emphatic and thoroughly checked my ear again. This time, his diagnosis and treatment was really helpful and he did his professional best to alleviate me of the lingering pain. I just want to say, Dr Tan is not only capable but in a true sense, upholds the meaning of being a doctor.  Not all doctors define their profession but Dr Tan is exemplary. He embodies the true meaning of what it means to be a doctor, which i have never encountered in any other doctor in Singapore. Kudos to you Dr Tan and sray humble and dedicated as you always are.

I have given you honest feedback on you front office ladies staff and i hope you do something actively about it. Every human is a patient at one time of their lives and the last we want is to be treated unkindly in a clinic. A smile is all it takes to remove the fear one has prior to seeing a kind doctor if they are lucky. Fortunately today, the Chinese lady in the treatment room was really kind and nice for a change. I deeply appreciate her gesture.

May God always shower his blessings on you Dr Tan.",en,6 months ago,2025-02-21T06:37:20.963015Z,Anannya S

But after we went back, it doesn't hit the spot as well as it did before. The food is still pretty decent, but not as good as it used to be. Prices have increased and the portion size has decreased, hence its not as worth it as it used to be anymore.
We ordered the truffle scrambled eggs, the ultimate combo and a sea salt caramel latte. The truffle scrambled eggs tasted pretty good, thought you might want to ask for some salt to add to it. The bread that comes with it was too dry in my opinion and you have to accompany it with the eggs. The ultimate combo has nice fluffy pancakes and the scrambled eggs that come with it was quite good. The sea salt latte was good as well, you can really taste the salt in it.

The Fried Prawn Mee from Tian Seng was like a roller coaster ride; I was shocked & disappointed at the start when I saw that the bigger $5 portion was so small... But once I tried it I fell in love 😍 the umami prawn & garlic flavour was so intense, and the noodles were cooked just right! Although the wok hei might be slightly lacking, but such intense prawn flavour is really hard to find. This might be one of my top 5!

I've had oyster omelette ($5) from Ghim Guan quite a few times, and the standard remains high. This rendition is wetter than others, but rich in flavours. I love how eggy this whole dish tastes and that the oysters were plump and juicy!

Lastly, the Claypot Chicken Rice ($7) from Nanxing was just decent, felt like there was nothing much to say about the rice. The chicken was very tender and fresh though!

Such a nice place for dinner, with quite a huge variety of stalls to choose from! I think this is a lesser known hawker which you should try visiting 😍",en,a month ago,2025-07-26T10:08:00.544513046Z,Jason Ng

He toasts his kaya toast over charcoals and as it’s a solo operation – time stands still here. The queue forms endlessly and he takes his time to prep drinks and food, oblivious of clock ticking. Other cheap and cheerful options – Barokah Muslin Food dishes out chicken rice to the crowds by the second I’m a pescatarian but I broke the rule to try their dark soya sauce leg which puts some of the restaurant offerings to shame.

Boy, were we surprised!

It connected right into the carpark and makes things easy for shoppers. That was the thing that we wered awed by.

Lets dive in!

Location:
Located in Blk 506, this seems to be last block before crossing to the polyclinic or first to head towards the busy areas. We remembered while younger that this was known as Prime supermarket. Years past and Sheng Siong took over and the place inside is totally unrecognizable.

Amenities:
Almost everything is sold here! There are beddings, shirts, wet groceries, fruits and more. There are also eateries less than a minute walk if you are hungry.

Service:
Staff were very helpful and were full of smiles. Not a common practice in supermarkets but great job!

All in all, check out their 2 storey supermarket with travellators in the middle yeah..

The 80 cents silky smooth flat noodles in the flavourful broth makes such a good value for money meal. Cost for 2 pax at $12.60 with me the greedy ordering extra intestines to make up the price.

👍 Waiting and registration time is short
👍 Clinic is spacious
👍 Dr Wong is nice and let me understand how to apply the cream correctly. He took my temperature and blood pressure. I’m here just for my rash and state I just want this particular cream so didn’t expect he went extra mile to ensure no fever and BP is in range.

The only 👎 is the consultation is $40 which I find it quite high compared to some $20ish.

I would also like to compliment Winston at Best Denki Parkway Parade for his excellent customer service and professionalism. Winston helped to install an additional SSD.

The rooms were super spacious—easily enough to fit 4 people comfortably. What really stood out to me was how thoughtful the design was. They had international sockets in the room, so we didn’t even have to bother with converters. This is something even 5-star hotels sometimes miss, so I was genuinely impressed.

The room also had a huge window that could be opened to let in fresh air (which is such a rare find in most hotels), along with an air conditioner. Free Wi-Fi and a TV were included too, which was a bonus. Every morning, they provided free water bottles, and the cleaning staff was always around and ready to help if you needed the room cleaned, the beds made, or the trash taken out. They were polite and never intrusive.

Another thing that really impressed me was their check-in and check-out timings. Check-in was at 2 PM and check-out at 12 PM. I can’t stress enough how convenient this was, especially when so many 5-star hotels these days want you to check in at 4 PM and rush you out by 11 AM. It’s those little details that make a big difference.

On top of all that, they offer free luggage storage for all their guests. This is such a thoughtful touch, especially considering most places charge extra for it.

What blew my mind the most was how affordable this place was. It didn’t cost us $$$ per night like you’d expect for such a great experience. Everything from the service to the amenities was top-notch, and it just didn’t feel like we were staying at a budget hotel. I genuinely believe Yaju is a hidden gem and way underrated.

If you’re planning to visit Singapore and want a comfortable yet affordable place to stay, I highly recommend Yaju Hotel. You’ll save money while still getting an amazing experience—and you can use those savings to explore the vibrant city of Singapura instead!",en,7 months ago,2025-01-29T03:01:03.080567Z,Kamal Preet Singh

The only downside was the mold on the ceiling, which was a little discomforting.
Also the walls are thin and you can hear your room neighbors.

The hotel is located in a small street between the MRT stations Kallang and Aljuned. Both are 15 mins away on foot, which is quite far.

Luckily there is a bus stop, which brings you directly to downtown area in a very short time. Don’t bother taking the MRT, take the bus.

Around the corner is a 7-11 and a washing salon, where you can wash and dry your clothes for less than 10SGD.

Nearby is also a Shieng Siong (supermarket), where you can buy cheap water bottles. The prices at 7-11 are way too high for water.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-24T06:07:39.759125Z,Martin

My back was actually very red and sore after this massage. The ambience of the shop is not good, can hear people working in the back, some sort of renovations, the room is not private, also can hear other staff eating and playing games on their phone. They made me wear horrible shorts for the massage, not clean at all, I was thinking the whole time who else has been wearing these and how often are they washed. Should be disposable pants or nothing at all. Also the price was wrong in the window. Really disappointed with this place, I won’t go back.",en,2 years ago,2023-05-08T07:28:50.187841Z,J H

To be honest, really quite disappointing. firstly, it didn’t taste like it was alcoholic. it was more like yakult. felt no kick at all even at the end. secondly, the tower was at least 50% ice. 2 litres? didn’t look like it. After 2 hours, the ice was still almost at 30%. I would’ve thought the ice would be separated from the beverage so that it wouldn’t dilute it. When i asked the staff about it, he says it’s not supposed to be separated. i felt scammed.

that said, the food was not bad. the sound system was good. i really hated the damn lights though. I switch it off, but after EVERY SINGLE SONG, at the NEXT SONG it COMES BACK ON! Please programme it such that it doesn’t come back on each time. It is really very frustrating and annoying!

So she spent an hour just massaging my body (without much strength) and towards the end, said come back for 正骨 another day? My body wasn’t ready for it.

HOWEVER, when collecting $ from me, she charged 正骨 price when massage was much cheaper. So I didn’t get what I want, yet paid premium and my body didn’t get the relief I needed. What a bummer!!

An unmanned venue that sells like a convenience store.

One of the latest concept store that has no cashier. The actual concept should be labelled as a cashierless convenience store. As there is still manpower around for stocks to be shelved and ensure that the process for payments and registrations.

The place is really the size of an average convenience store. There are coolers for drinks, ice-cream and snacks readily available for purchase. In terms of pricing, it is slightly cheaper than those convenience stores, ehem 7-ehem.. Which is a good deal for customers. Many can actually come by to jz purchase easily without the need of a cashier.. Actually Giant supermarket has this concept for a long time liao. So ya, same la..

Entry must be via ur palm, as it is the required choice of usage. Make sure u register 1st and link ur paylah before entering as it is part of the registrations. So ya lo, easy in, easy out. D reason why we gave it a 4 star venue is because d items available is limited and there could be better options that can be incorporated into this.

Go check it out, cheers!!

Unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory.
As a family of two adults and two small children, we were shocked to find ourselves placed in an extremely small, windowless room that did not match the images or descriptions on the booking site. The photos online were very misleading and felt like false advertising. Given the price we paid—over $1000 AUD—we expected at least a family-suitable room with basic comfort.
We requested an early checkout and refund upon seeing the room, but the receptionist simply told us to contact Booking.com and offered no further help. The lack of assistance or empathy from the hotel staff was deeply disappointing. It felt as though, once they received our payment, they no longer cared about our experience.
We've moved to Holiday Inn hotel for just a slightly higher price, and the difference in quality and service is substantial—larger room, better amenities, and a pool.
We hope Booking.com responds to our refund request, but regardless, we mgacannot recommend this hotel to other families. It was a frustrating and disheartening experience.

We were both feeling stiff and achy, so we decided to find a massage parlor to help us unwind. We found Zu Le Yuan Healthcare Massage on Google, and it had good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.

When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find that their prices were very reasonable.  A one-hour massage was only $35, and for $50, we could get a one-and-a-half hour massage.  We decided to go for the longer treatment, which was a great decision.

The massage itself was fantastic. The therapist really knew how to pinpoint all the pressure points on our feet and legs.  It was a perfect way to relieve the muscle aches we had from the cycling event.  The massage room was clean and cozy, and they had soft instrumental music playing in the background.  It created a very relaxing atmosphere.

After the massage, they didn't have hot tea, but they did offer us warm water, which was still very welcome.

Overall, we thought Zu Le Yuan Healthcare Massage was a great find. The massage was excellent, the price was very reasonable, and the atmosphere was relaxing.  We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good massage in Tampines.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-28T08:58:48.336472Z,Doraemon

There is free plain water. Staff are friendly. Will return to try their breakfast which staff mentioned is nice.",en,a year ago,2024-05-07T04:30:46.653656Z,Sabrina Ng

This popular stall is well-known for its unique addition of crispy silver fish and vegetables. As expected, there was a queue, so I joined in. The lady stall owner typically takes your order when you're still 2–3 people away from the front. The environment is quite noisy, so if you don’t speak loudly enough, she may get frustrated and ask you to repeat or confirm your order.

I ordered a large plate at $5.50, requested it without cockles, and was served a generous portion that included three prawns, crispy fried silver fish, and vegetables. The dish was tasty and satisfying, with no aftertaste of thirst—definitely worth recommending. However, it would be better if orders were taken only when customers are closer to the front of the queue.

We also ordered a medium-sized claypot rice from Yew Chuan Claypot Rice stall at $15, suitable for two to share. It came with salted fish, Chinese sausage, and chicken slices. The flavors were well-balanced, and the stall owner was kind enough to serve it directly to our table. For those who enjoy more protein, I’d recommend requesting extra chicken—though it may come with an additional charge.

Will definitely explore Golden Mile Food Centre again, as I’ve read there are many other stalls offering delicious food worth trying.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-04T07:45:26.614407Z,N. Gan

21st Aug, screen has been replaced for me in 20mins and technician jeffrey came out to verify with me to make sure everything is ok. very pleasant  and friendly guy. service recovery is there and it is done on the spot.

On 13th Feb, The manager has called and out of goodwill, will be replacing the top case of the Macbook which shipment could take abit of time. Have adjusted the rating slightly, will re-update when case is replaced.

My 2019 MacBook Pro stopped charging and the battery died. After reading a positive review of LYK’s Tai Seng branch, I decided to bring it in for repair on January 26th, 2025. The repair took about 12 days, which is understandable given the Chinese New Year holiday.

The issue was diagnosed as a short circuit, and the repair included a battery replacement.

I’ve just collected my MacBook, and the repair was done at a reasonable cost. However, I was quite disappointed to find deep scratches and dents on the top cover, which weren’t there before. I always kept my MacBook in a case, and even the rubber feet look brand new. The repair restored its functionality, but the aesthetics were affected. While I understand minor hairline scratches or dents due to repairs, the deep scratches are unacceptable, especially considering that I have two other work MacBooks that I’ve used without cases, and they don’t show such damage.

I paid half the repair cost and am waiting for the manager to respond regarding the issue.

Suggestion: I noticed some MacBooks were left upside down on the table and others were only wrapped in bubble wrap. It might be helpful to standardize all repairs by wrapping the devices in bubble wrap and using clean rubber mats during the process.",en,a week ago,2025-08-21T13:00:20.003184592Z,Tan Darren

He's a really professional and good doctor who takes time to ask questions and do all necessary checks/tests to better determine a diagnosis.

I've seen him since he was still a doctor in Ntuc Income clinic at Rivervale Mall (in fact, since more than 20 years ago 😂)

Very sad ever since he shifted much further away to Punggol, but I will always visit him when doctors in clinics nearer to home or under my company's panel cannot help me, and every single time, Dr Fong managed to properly diagnose me, prescribe the right medicine and gave me all necessary advice for me to feel better soon.

Their waiting time has always epic since Sengkang times (the aunties manning the counter may not be the nicest people around, but they're just very direct 😂 not sure if the aunties I know are still working there but oh well), but the wait is always worth it when you know that the doctor will be able to help you in one way or another. ☺️

Understand that one may be easily irritated or feel very unwell when you are sick, but patience is needed at clinics everywhere, hence it would be great if more patients visiting Healthbridge clinic can be more understanding and less demanding. (Trust me, I've seen too much nasty patients...😅)

Regardless, we are definitely fortunate to be under Dr. Fong's care when we visit his clinic.

Personal favorites include their delicious Tomato Egg and Lemon Chicken. The food is freshly prepared.

However, I do want to note that the curry chicken can be a bit of a letdown for those who are sensitive to strong chicken smells. so if you're particularly sensitive, you may want to opt for their fried chicken dishes instead.

Overall, Sinfood is a great option for a healthy and  affordable meal in Changi Business Park. Give it a try!""

I recently visited this cai fan (economic rice) stall, and I have to say that I was really disappointed.
While I was expecting an affordable meal, what I got was nothing short of shocking in terms of pricing. For just two vegetables and a small portion of fish, I was charged $9.

The vegetables were decent but nothing special — standard cai fan price, though portions were on the smaller side.

In terms of taste, it was passable, but definitely not worth $9. I've had far better meals at other cai fan stalls at a lower cost. Too much!",en,8 months ago,2024-12-09T11:01:02.621540Z,TESSA

Loved how spacious the place is. Wide area for people to walk, huge ceiling fans through the entire hawker centre to dissipate the heat.

Wide variety of food, halal/non-halal also have. Different cuisines as well.

There are repeated food brands from nearby hawker centres but glad to see other food brands from other parts of Singapore. Ah Tan wings for example from Yishun Park HC.

Wash basins are provided too for both children and adults alike.

Some greenery in the middle makes the place slightly more refreshing and the open top for the plants to get sunlight.

Great design of a hawker centre so far.

Overall food here is so much better compared to the other hawkers centres near here.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-25T11:11:18.561865Z,Bryan Fang

The guy attending to me then pass me 2 half boiled eggs, put it in boiling water and ask me to wait for 10 mins. I waited way past 10 mins, took out the egg and cracked one of it but jt was still soft so I went back to the shop to ask if they could help me boil it longer to make it hard boiled. They say they can’t and if I want I can exchange an egg for another cooked egg used for mee siam at $1.

I was willing to pay for it to become hard boiled as it was for my daughter but why do I need to give back 1 egg and pay $1 for another egg. The lady mentioned that the half boiled egg cost $0.8 and the hard boiled egg cos $1.2 so shouldn’t I pay the difference of $0.40 since I’m returning the half boiled egg? In the end, I didn’t want to argue any further so I just returned the half boiled, paid $1 and took a hard boiled egg.",en,a month ago,2025-07-06T02:22:19.483225458Z,Joel Chew

Despite initially choosing this hotel due to its convenient location and reasonable rates, my experience was marred by a series of issues that significantly impacted my stay.

Upon arrival, I encountered discomforting situations, including strange individuals loitering around the premises and unsettling phone calls from unidentified numbers. Despite raising my concerns with Agoda and the hotel management, the resolution process was prolonged and unsatisfactory.

Throughout my stay, I faced multiple challenges, from safety concerns to maintenance issues. Despite efforts to address these concerns, including requests for room changes and assistance with amenities such as the water heater and air conditioning, the problems persisted. The lack of running water and malfunctioning air conditioning were particularly frustrating, making it difficult to carry out daily tasks and impacting my overall comfort.

Additionally, the discovery of bed bugs in the room was distressing, highlighting significant cleanliness and hygiene concerns. Despite notifying the hotel management and requesting assistance, the resolution process was slow, and the recurring issues remained unaddressed.

While the hotel staff attempted to assist with the challenges, the overall experience was disappointing. The constant back-and-forth communication to resolve issues detracted from the relaxation and enjoyment of my stay.

In summary, my experience at K Hotel 14 fell short of expectations. Despite its convenient location, the numerous challenges and recurring issues significantly impacted my stay, leaving me dissatisfied with the overall experience.",en,a year ago,2024-02-18T01:34:29.357930Z,Tricia Teixeira

Based on the previous reviews, it is true that the website photos are different upon seeing the hotel by yourself. My room was Room 602. I used a manual key with a broken key card that you will use to light up your room. My floor was with the group of workers staying in the bunk bed rooms. Their safety shoes were placed outside their rooms which will make you feel uncomfortable. Most of the guests are Indians, Bangladeshi, Chinese and Vietnamese. My room was with broken remote AC (AC was too cold you cannot lower the temp), broken bed frame, dilapidated vinyl floors and curtain with holes. There were no coffee and tea in the room as advertised. Water is just upon arrival. There is no shampoo provided, only beauty bath gel that appears to be store-bought. Location is in the Indian and Bangladeshi community. Too far from train station, a little far to bus station. There were 2 uncles and 1 lady in the reception during my stay but I just greeted them and never asked anything as it appears they are having difficulty speaking in English.

(A LITTLE) GOOD: it seems that they are trying to improve their facilities and service (based on the previous reviews), but definitely will take time to succeed. Water pressure in the toilet is good, though toilet is really small. The single room is literally for single Asian person and not for tall and huge Western person. Location has a lot of restaurants but a little far from Hawker Centers.

If you will ask me if I will return to the hotel, YES. I will visit them again to see the improvement they will make after this review.",en,a year ago,2023-11-08T10:42:06.430011Z,N G

I do have some suggestions to the timing, do try to do your massage earlier in the day so that you will be able to maximise the benefits for the wrap.

Completed in 2022 by acclaimed artist Didier 'Jaba' Mathieu, Jalan Jalan is a striking mural nestled in the heart of Joo Chiat, an area known for its cultural richness and Peranakan charm. Using a bold mix of aerosol and Weatherbond paint, Jaba transforms the wall into a dynamic canvas of movement, spirit, and introspection.
The mural celebrates the untroubled freedom of a stray cat, a powerful metaphor for resilience and independence. With a daring color palette drawn from Peranakan ceramics, the piece pulses with energy and visual complexity, marrying tradition with contemporary street art.
Beyond its aesthetic brilliance, Jalan Jalan carries an emotional depth — it encourages viewers to confront life’s uncertainties with courage and confidence, echoing the fearless curiosity of the street cat it honors. It’s not just a mural; it’s a message.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-03T13:10:30.011210Z,Z

I recently had the opportunity to stay at Snooze Hotel Singapore, and while there are some positive aspects to highlight, there are also several shortcomings that future guests should be aware of.

Location – 4.5/5

One of the biggest advantages of Snooze Hotel is its central location. It is conveniently situated near public transport options, making it easy to explore the city. Major attractions, shopping areas, and restaurants are within walking distance, which adds to the convenience. Whether you're a business traveler or a tourist, the location is undoubtedly a strong point.

Check-in and Customer Service – 3.5/5

The check-in process was fairly smooth, but not particularly welcoming. The staff were polite but seemed somewhat indifferent. While they answered questions when asked, they didn’t go out of their way to make guests feel at home. A bit more warmth and enthusiasm would certainly improve the experience.

Rooms and Amenities – 3/5

The rooms at Snooze Hotel are compact, which is expected in Singapore, but they are clean and functional. The bed was comfortable, and the air conditioning worked well, which is crucial in Singapore’s humid climate. However, the lack of basic amenities like milk or creamer for tea and coffee was disappointing. When I asked the staff about it, they simply said they don’t provide it, which seems unusual for a hotel. It’s a small detail, but for many travelers, having a proper cup of tea or coffee in the morning is a simple comfort that should be standard.

The bathroom was small but clean, with decent water pressure and hot water available. However, the toiletries provided were quite basic, so if you have specific preferences, it’s best to bring your own.

Noise Levels – 3/5

One issue I noticed was the thin walls. Noise from the hallway and neighboring rooms was quite noticeable, especially at night. If you’re a light sleeper, I’d recommend bringing earplugs.

Breakfast and Dining – 2.5/5

Snooze Hotel doesn’t have a full-service restaurant, and the breakfast options were very limited. There are plenty of eateries nearby, but it would be nice if the hotel offered a better selection of breakfast items. The lack of in-room milk or creamer for coffee and tea only adds to the inconvenience.

Value for Money – 3/5

Singapore is known for expensive accommodations, and Snooze Hotel falls into the budget-to-mid-range category. While it offers a clean and convenient stay, the lack of attention to small details—like customer service, soundproofing, and basic room amenities—makes it feel slightly overpriced for what you get.

Final Verdict – 3/5

Snooze Hotel Singapore is a decent option for budget-conscious travelers who prioritize location over luxury. However, the lack of small but essential amenities (like milk/creamer for coffee and tea), thin walls, and the impersonal service mean that there are better options available at a similar price point. If you’re staying for a short trip and just need a place to sleep, it might be worth considering.

However, if you’re looking for comfort, good service, and better in-room provisions, you may want to explore other hotels in the area.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-26T13:18:45.413294Z,Heena Mohanlal

Ronald who claimed to be the supervisor refused to ask the employee who had collected interest payment and claimed that they didn't collect. I am putting them into the hands of law because I went to the association but they only listened to their story. Common sense tells you the only evidence is the video but first they refused then they said no more record. Unbelievable that they think they can get away without the proof. I am filing a compliance with the law and MP of Tampines to nab any unethical organization especially during this covid where innocence should not be put in the advantage stage.

Meat, veggies, you name it… all marinated, grilled and smoky in the best way.

From smoky meats to late-night feasts, this is your new go-to for flavour, fun and a little chaos.

Think juicy skewers, bold bites and even hot food like grilled fish with ice-cold drinks like beer!

Perfect for a night out with your buddies and family.

Repeat customer, and for good reason. The technician is exceptionally honest and skilled at troubleshooting complex issues. He's handled challenging repairs for my wife's iPhone (motherboard issue, which we initially thought to be screen-related) which was fixed after 24 hours.

Originally referred by my friend, who had a salt-water damaged phone, which the technician worked tirelessly to resolve (was intense - has to try ways to access the storage).

What sets this shop apart: clear communication about repair chances, multiple parts options (from generic to original) with transparent pricing, and upfront information about potential complications. Won't oversell or over-promise.

Technically solid, genuinely helpful, and trustworthy. Just make sure you're at the right location! (there might be a similar-looking shop nearby)",en,7 months ago,2025-01-12T09:16:03.419593Z,Jingshun Lim

A little disappointed is that, me and my friend placed our drinks on the table and place a new packet of tissues on the table as we go and order some foods.. End up just less than 3 minutes.. the cleaner kept our drink and keep my pack of tissue.. and said no one inform her not to keep! So end up the just ordered drink just a few sips and was kept.. and end up we had to order 2 more can of drinks..

I understand they are doing their works.. but need a little common sense.. I think across the table we are sitting we are ordering something that can see where we are.. but for us just turn our head and drinks all kept.. Furthermore.. we were there at 5+pm.. not crowded during this timing.. in fact only a few table occupied..  I don't see the basic courtesy to ask or wait a while.

I think is happened to all of coffee shops..  Is this what they are taught.. So customer can order more drinks again? Pardon me for saying this a encounter quite a few times.. sometimes they keep my beer..🤦🤦",en,a month ago,2025-07-18T14:39:09.847941324Z,Marcus Nah

I stay about 5 minutes away.

At 9am, the clinic opens, there were 2 to 3 patients ahead of me. (Plot thickens at the end of this post)

At 9.15am when it's my turn, I showed the queue number on my mobile phone and queue changed to 20+??? And was told that waiting duration is about 2 hours.

I asked the reception politely, wow I didn't know there were so many patients already ahead of me in a short 10 to 15 minutes. (Must be because today is the 1st day of the lunar 7 month that's why I can't see ""them"")

Recep said whatever number is on my eHA app is my queue number.

Abit disgruntled but I thought to myself, it's OK, maybe those people ahead of me used the eHA app earlier than me. (Plot thickens once again)

At around 10am, a lady approach the recep, recep asked her if she came before, lady shooked head. She was given queue number 16.

I WAS SO PUZZLED.
Yet again, I lied to myself maybe because the lady has got whatever tests or her condition is worse than mine.

At 10.30am, another lady approached the counter and recep said that even though she has gotten a queue number using eHA, she will still need to be physically at the clinic to register. (then what about ""them""?)

I WAS PUZZLED AGAIN.
What is the purpose of downloading eHA then?
Is it only for us to monitor the queue number and get prepared?

Enlighten me please!

The first staff member who initially attended to me was more focused on chatting with a colleague than ensuring proper registration. This oversight caused an unnecessary delay and wasted my time. Thankfully, another staff member quickly assisted me once the mistake was realized, and I received my vaccine within 5 minutes.

In times of urgency, we have sought their care, but after several visits, I find myself hesitant to return. Recently, I called the clinic to clarify a matter that I was frustrated with myself about.

I took my six-year-old child to the clinic, hoping to get clearance from a possible HFMD case, unaware of a single ulcer at the back of his throat. The doctor I saw (I don’t recall his name) explained the possibility of HFMD before examining my child. At that moment, I was ready to leave rather than incur a significant fee unnecessarily. I believe it would have been helpful if the doctor had informed me upfront that as long as symptoms were present, clearance wouldn’t be possible. That way, I could have simply taken my son home to wait it out instead of proceeding with the consultation.

After the consultation which went on without a choice since I did not speak up, the doctor asked if I needed any medication, and I declined. At the nurse's counter, I was asked again, but it was not explained that declining medication would result in a minimum charge of $10. Had I known, I could have chosen a medication costing $5 and avoided that extra fee. While the clinic is not obligated to explain this, a simple clarification would have been helpful. In the end, I paid an additional $10 on top of the consultation fee, which totaled $49.50.

I take responsibility for my own decision, but I do feel the doctor could have advised me to wait and return only if symptoms persisted. Clearer communication from both the doctor and the staff would have made for a much better experience.

I have spoken with one of the nurses when I called in few weeks back.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-02T02:33:59.802814Z,Carol Lim

I would also like to commend one of your staff at the 705 East Coast Road Outlet. I believe he is called Kit. I have been going to this particular 7-11 outlet regularly as I work nearby and Kit has always been very helpful and friendly. When a particular item that I wanted was out of stock, he would order it in and come over to let me know that the items are back in stock even though I did not specifically ask him to order it in for me. I feel that Kit has really gone out of his way to provide the best service he can to myself and other customers as well. It is rare to find a staff member like Kit who goes the extra mile to better serve his customers as well as the community. Thumbs up!",en,4 years ago,2021-07-22T04:11:39.084747Z,Matthew Chow

I just wanted to share how impressed I was with my recent visit. The service was absolutely awesome – warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming from start to finish. It made the entire experience feel extra special.

The place itself is cozy and beautiful, with such a nice ambiance that instantly puts you at ease. And the cocktails – wow! I’ve never had drinks served with such attention to scent before. It was my first time experiencing that in Singapore, and it added such a unique, sensory touch that really elevated the experience. Awesome stuffs, kudos!

Food was amazing. Noodles has pork lard inside, the tasty anchovies soup has a generous portion of veggies and meat. A very satisfying meal indeed.

Do give it a try.

To start the fried kway Teow tasted healthier than I expected. It wasn’t too salty. It wasn’t too sweet and it wasn’t too sweet. Just a nice blend of flavor as well as tenderness of the noodles. A delightful a great dish to start with.
On the satay, the meat was tender, easy to rip off from the stick. The peanut sauce was nice. It wasn’t over powering with the peanut taste not too oily as well. It was a nice mixture with the meat on my taste palette. highly recommended

Moving on to the chicken wing
Nicely grill no char area. Easy to rip off the meat from the bone. had a good time as I do not need to wrestle with the chicken wing to chew off the meat from the bone

And finally not forgetting the youji duck.
I ordered half a duck.
I am always happy with the quality of the duck meat

================
I visited Rong Yuan Coffeeshop on 9 Aug 2025 and bought lunch from the economy rice stall (named Ruyi 如意). It was cheap and good. Two veg and one meat only cost $2.80 (additional $0.20 for takeaways). There was a wide variety of dishes to choose from and I paid $3 for a generous packet of sweet and sour pork, long beans and braised potatoes (sliced), with the dishes entirely covering the white rice (see photos). The dishes were as tasty as the ones sold at neighbouring economy rice stalls where three such identical dishes cost $3.70 or more. Highly recommend to try!
============

Today (11 Aug 2025), I bought lunch from the economy rice stall, Ruyi, again. The quality and quantity were consistent with the previous visit. This time, for $3, I had sweet and sour pork, Shanghai green and scrambled eggs with tomatoes, generously stacked on the white rice. Great value for money!
=========

Tonight (13 Aug 2025), I bought dinner from the economy rice stall, Ruyi. I tried a different selection of dishes this time. I had curry chicken, Chinese spinach and pumpkin. It also cost $3.
=========

I patronised Ruyi economy rice stall on 15 Aug 2025 again. My dinner for $3 was hairy gourd, sausages with potatoes and braised tau pok. I tried to select a different variety of dishes each visit. The stall owner was recommending the bitter gourd dish but I told him I dislike eating bitter gourds. For those who like bitter gourds, you probably can give it a try! 😅
===========

Today (18 Aug 2025), I bought lunch from the Western food stall, Deli Delight. They were having a promotion - grilled chicken chop with brown or black pepper sauce, coleslaw and fries at $6. Dine in orders even came with free mushroom soup. (The promotion is valid for Mondays to Fridays, 12pm to 5pm). So, I dined in today. The chicken chop was tender and juicy. The black pepper sauce was thick with a strong peppery taste. The mushroom soup was also creamy and rich. For $6, it was truly a good bargain that I could not have asked for more. Do give it a try before the promotion ends. You'll definitely get your money's worth!
==========

Today (21 Aug 2025), I bought lunch from the Fried Kway Teow stall, which shared the same stall premise as Feng Le 灃乐 Hainanese Chicken Rice. The char kway teow ($4) was cheap and delicious. There were abundant chinese sausages, fish cakes, bean sprouts and much to my surprise, it also came with cockles (about four or five cockles). Many char kway teow stalls do not include cockles for $4 portion size these days. The kway teow itself was well cooked, adequately blended with sweet sauce and egg, not too dry or too oily. The lime juice added some sourness to the sweetness, which provided some layer to the taste. All in all, it was well worth the price. I'll eat it again!",en,a week ago,2025-08-21T10:13:15.078818837Z,Poh Ling Chan

New stalls are carrot cake cubes and chilli king wanton noodle. Not sure if the zichar stall is closed for good, not seen them operating for past 2 weeks

Update dec 2021
There goes the dessert stall and come a western stall cheekylads.

Update aug 2021
Chilli king wanton noodle is located here. Not too bad for their wanton noodle

Updated jun2021
Chicken rice nicely fragrance. Chicken meat is ok but not for the char siew. Char siew abit in the hard to chew. Stall owner is friendly though

Next to the chicken rice stall is selling dessert like chendol and tua suan. Not too bad but the way this stall.is set up, dont seem like the seller is planning to be here long but just trying out if this place is suitable for his dessert

The fried hokkien mee stall no longer in operation but in place is a mokata and lok lok stall..seem pretty popular, can see many eating at the coffeeshop

Older post
Fried hokkien mee is good. The indian stall serves good prata too. Recently the coffeeshop went thru some renovation for better shelter and more seating area.

Coffee and tea here is nice here and thick, not the usual sugar water tea you find in most coffee shops.

The seafood hor fun stall is new and quite popular. Tried the yee mee, those who like lot of port lard will love it.",en,3 years ago,2022-03-26T05:49:24.884769Z,Backyard Xplorer

New stall selling western called Cheekylads has good size portions! I’ve tried their cream pasta, grilled chicken and fish & chips.

I personally like the pasta and grilled chicken. The chicken is grilled till the outsides are crispy and still moist on the inside. The pasta portions are big, good for big eaters.

The grilled chicken with cheese is also enjoyable - they’re very generous with the cheese portions. Good for those who love cheese!

Their coleslaw is also fresh (I’m very particular about coleslaws, I seldom eat it actually) but I could savour a few mouths from this stall.",en,3 years ago,2022-01-30T06:24:26.366998Z,Sherilyn Leah Tan

The staff are very friendly and even teach my son how to play dart. The service is good.

During the visit, I also asked them to check an issue I had been experiencing with an uncomfortable ride over uneven roads. They quickly identified that my suspension needed fixing and resolved it efficiently. Also, they diagnosed a lingering coolant issue that had been bugging me since I got the car nearly a year ago.

The team was professional, transparent, and their pricing was fair. Huge thanks to Uncle Tiong and Uncle Fong for the excellent service. No more bumpy rides!",en,a month ago,2025-07-04T16:22:30.771929781Z,Zen Hann Seah

1 week ago I was overcharged by the shop beside them (tong lee wee) who charged me $24 to change 1 brake light…

Eventually they charged me $35 to change 2 brake lights.

Which 1 become spoiled just after 1 week.

I tried Mao Yang, and they charged me just $5, and got the job done in less than 5 mins!

My phone display was acting up (white and green), and I wasn't sure what the issue was, so I decided to bring it in for repairs. From start to finish, everything was incredibly smooth and efficient. The prices were incredibly affordable and much more competitive than other shops I had checked out. I was pleasantly surprised by how reasonable the cost was given the quality of service I received. (They even gave me a free screen protector!).

The repair itself was done in just 30 minutes! I was impressed by how quickly the team worked without compromising on the quality of the fix. It’s not often you find a place that can handle a repair so swiftly while still doing a thorough job.

What really stood out, though, was the staff. They were so friendly and approachable, making the whole experience feel warm and welcoming. They took the time to explain the issue with my phone and answered all my questions in a way that was easy to understand. Their customer service truly exceeded my expectations.

Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the service I received. I highly recommend SMA MOBILE to anyone looking for fast, affordable, and top-notch phone repairs. I'll definitely be coming back if I need any future repairs!",en,4 months ago,2025-04-08T12:43:06.541296Z,Jiayu Tan

I’d like to compliment one of your male staff members who was working at the Sheng Siong branch near Layar LRT on 17 July 2025, around 8pm+. I was buying some clams and prawns, and he was extremely friendly and helpful. He patiently helped me identify and pick out the dead clams, showed me a sample, and kindly explained that I should avoid choosing those in the future as they were already dead and may not be fresh. I truly appreciated his sincerity, it shows he genuinely cares about what customers are buying.

Although he was in the middle of doing something and bending down, he was very aware of his surroundings. The moment he noticed me standing there, he immediately looked up, gave a warm smile, and swiftly reached out to take over the items I needed to weigh — 超神反應 (lightning-fast reflexes)! That small moment already gave me a great first impression.

To be honest, I rarely shop at Sheng Siong. I usually go to FaxxPrixx,  but I’ve had multiple unpleasant experiences there, such as getting hit by trolleys or baskets while staff were collecting them, and overall their service attitude could really need improvement. 😅

This experience at Sheng Siong completely changed my perception. Staff are the face of any company, and this employee truly represented the brand with excellence. Because of his service, I’ll definitely be choosing Sheng Siong more often from now on.

Kudos to him for his professionalism and great customer service, he really made a difference!",en,a month ago,2025-07-17T13:47:21.248373554Z,Vittoria Choon

I had to remove it from the wrappings and steamed it for another 15 minutes. The Kee Chang with red bean is no different. It remains hard after about 15 minutes steaming.

He also asked thoughtful questions about my son's appetite and behaviour before giving a diagnosis, which made me feel he was really paying attention. He even highlighted that flu vaccines are free for Singaporean children and suggested I consider it, which I appreciated.

She was rude throughout the entire process. Forgoing the incident happened. I got a room but I decided to extend for a few more hours. I checked all the rooms around my floor that I stayed but I was unable to extend for a few more hours cause Joyce told me I didn’t ask for that amount of hours. She also told me she would blacklist me because I was trying to force a late checkout but I was still left with ten minutes. Utterly disappointing. Fire that fat woman now.

Clinic opens at 830, and I walked in for consultation. I had no prior booking made & was told to come back at 10-1010 for my next appointment. Note, there was only 1 uncle in the clinic at that point in time & there was no other patients waiting outside.

Came back at 1018, was told to wait outside. Proceeded outside & saw the crowd, and I noticed that the indoor seats were mostly vacant. Puzzled, I went back in to ask why cannot wait inside. The admin lady (short hair wear spects) just snapped at me to wait outside without giving any reason.

Waited outside for another 10 minutes before going in to ask how long till my turn. The other lady told me 3 more patients. What's the point of scheduling an appointment when it's not even accurate?

I gave up & cancelled my appointment. Walked in at 326 Anchorvale instead, from entering to leaving clinic took less than 30 minutes. Fast & polite service from both admin & doctor. Consumers like us pay money for your service, we don't owe you anything. You're not the only clinic so wake up your idea.

What stood out most was how family-friendly it was. The kids were completely immersed in the games challenging one another with their scores. There’s something for every age, and even adults will find the simulations and airport trivia fascinating.

Entry was seamless. The staff were friendly, and the space is clean, well-lit, and comfortably air-conditioned.

Inside got red apple, green apple. pineapple, radish, cucumber, taupok.

𝐏𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐚𝐡 is also not bad, spicy enough to make me wish I had gotten 2 roll instead.

Also had 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐎𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞 - taste is not bad but find it too starchy, should have ordered the one with egg instead and if it's crispy more good also loh.

𝐌𝐢𝐱𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 with Broccoli, Cabbage, Fried Egg & Fried Prawn - If you don't know what to get just go picked whatever you want.

Ended our meal with a dessert of 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐥 however it didn't taste very good and it came in a takeaway container which I find it hard to dig the ingredients that are at the bottom.

Taste good but don’t order 蚝煎. Too much flour and only 5 whole oysters for $6 portion. the 蚝蛋 might be more worth it.

update: weeks later, i went back and bought the egg version also $6 - take out. a lot more oysters but overall i prefer the flour version ONLY because i could further fry it up at home until its super crispy and the flavour with each crunch is so much more satisfying.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-25T10:06:53.979357810Z,Moonlight

From the moment I entered Chuan Spa, I felt welcomed into a calming sanctuary. The decor was elegantly understated, and the atmosphere felt relaxing without any pretense.

🪔 Sky’s Expert Touch with Hot Oil
I booked a 90-minute hot oil massage—no herbal tea or element diagnostic was involved. Sky, my massage therapist, began by warming the rich oils and gently applying them across my body. Her technique expertly balanced warmth and pressure:

Fluid yet firm strokes that eased away tension while maintaining a soothing rhythm.

Intuitive pressure control, identifying tight areas and adjusting in real‑time to my comfort.

Highly recommend to book appointment with Sky.",en,4 weeks ago,2025-07-30T09:40:45.360724925Z,Wong KW

Jenny is incredibly skilled, intuitive, and professional. She has a great sense of pressure and rhythm, making sure you're completely relaxed throughout the session. Whether you go for the hot oil massage or the hot stone massage, you're in for a treat — both are excellent choices that melt away stress and muscle tension.

The massage itself is a head-to-toe experience, covering every area with care and precision. For gentlemen especially, it’s the perfect way to release all the built-up tension from long work weeks or constant stress.

I understand the residents have some agreement regarding the cheers visitors usage of the parking space and activity area after shopping. But it is never my concerns.

This morning, at around 8:50am on 29 June 2024, I stepped in the Cheers to buy a specific tea drinks I enjoy before I need to head to work.  I quickly took my drink, and asked a Chinese male in the uniform for assistance. He was between the shelves and there was no one in the cashier.

I asked: can I have some assistance?

To my surprise, instead of coming forward to assisting me or seeking his colleague to help if there is a distribution of scope of work , he started don't you know Thai person is the assistance, and he continues to educate me about the job description without remembering his colleagues name.

I am not interested in knowing how this Cheers is organised, so I turned to find the Thai person who I am supposed to approah (?) in their office or storage area behind the door next to the cashier counter.

The lady was still in her casual clothes, no uniform.

Thus. I turned and looked for the Chinese male in uniform again simply because the lady is not in her uniform yet.

The Chinese male came forward to giving me future lectures and Shih me.

I am offended.

I told him don't Shih me.  This uniformed staff then continued his behaviour by sayin  ""I am shihing myself. ""

I told him,""good"". Then I put my drink back to the selling shelf as I am not really interested in this staff management issue.  He then came following me in the shop by stopping what he is doing but also fail to provide any service. He  said"" you can complain to my management if you want. My name is Samuel. ""

I told him I don't have time for that, but I can choose not to be a customer. Then I left at 0855.

I know this Cheers may have Human power issue as I see the Thai lady usually for night shift. This Cheers closes at 11pm.  The previous Chinese lady at night shift seems left within a month as I have seen her using her personal phone chatting and scolding clients for don't give her lecture as she was trained and got a certificate.

I don't know and I am not interested in knowing if my event this morning would be catch under CCTV or there would be an internal report in Cheers. Still,I think all these episodes I mentioned above deserves a google comments for people who care to be treated as a customer.",en,a year ago,2024-06-29T01:23:14.542865Z,Abby Lin

We visited so many places in one day and he knew I liked alot of pictures so he also helped me in taking alot of pictures.  Aaron will not act like a tour guide but more like a friend in such a way that you would feel very comfortable.  He went all out for me. He even paid for a gold chain on my behalf of which I compensated him at the end of the trip . I give Aaron 10/10. He in no way failed me. Today I can look back at my photos and show my family the amazing time I had luckily for Aaron. I highly recommend Aaron as your guide. You won't regret it at all.

Beautiful as it is, suits for daily wear or for stacking with other jewelleries, simply elegant even as causal wear.  I was told that it is the only Italian design set they have got for now.

I like how that for every car that they repair/service, the mechs are meticulous and ensure magnetic body protection is secured on your car when they work on your engine bay - something that isn’t standard for many 3rd party workshops (but a norm for official car agent workshops) : this actually helps to avoid accidental dings/scratches and nasty oily finger/hand prints which are very apparent on light coloured cars.

Overall, their comms are spot on and timely and I would not hesitate to highly recommend them to anyone!

Had a great experience at this car workshop. I communicated with the boss, Sebastian, over text, and he was very responsive and easy to deal with. I initially brought my car in thinking the steering wheel just needed alignment. After his staff did the alignment and took the car for a test drive, they found it still wandered to the left.

What really stood out was how thorough they were. Instead of just telling me what was wrong and pushing for a sale, they did more troubleshooting, including swapping the tyres, but the issue persisted. They then jacked up the car and found that the lower arm suspension was likely the problem. The staff even had me sit in the passenger seat during a test drive to show me exactly what they were talking about, which gave me peace of mind that the issue was real and not something bogus. Not sure if this is common practice, but it definitely helped build trust.

Pricing was fair and transparent, and I’m glad I brought my car here. Overall, a very positive experience with a knowledgeable and honest team. Highly recommend!",en,10 months ago,2024-10-12T08:21:48.715979Z,Xiu Kai Sua

Highly recommend if you’re looking to get your new or used phone!",en,2 months ago,2025-06-21T11:13:21.143578259Z,ʍɾɴ

The price was very competitive and the added bonus of free delivery was a huge plus for me, especially as I travel frequently for work.

After receiving the phone, I booked a follow-up appointment to have a screen protector applied at their Tampines branch. The entire process was impressively quick—I was able to wait there and collect my phone within just a few minutes.

The staff were professional, efficient and incredibly polite, particularly the team at Tampines. Their service exceeded my expectations.

Overall, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. I would definitely recommend Mister Mobile to anyone looking for reliable mobile services and products in Singapore.

Bed sheets were no longer white , towels were very old, drippings from air conditioning, informed the receptionist but they don’t care . Reception even told me that the room will get serviced if the keys are handed back to them. I don’t bother about but they still got in your room without permission to turn off the air conditioning while I was away. Singapore is very hot and humid, if you don’t turn on the aircon ahead, the room will be stuffy when you get back ! So i totally not recommend at that price $75 per night for one single bed with no windows.

We had visited Hub and Spoke before, but this is our first time checking out its attached overflow bar. We came for the Easter event, and it turned out to be a fantastic outing. There were a good variety of activities thoughtfully setup to keep the kids entertained. From games to craft to egg hunt. The staff were very warm, friendly, and interacted really well with the young ones.

For the adults, there was a 1 for 1 happy hour beer promo running during the day. And the food portions were generous. All the food were delivered from the Hub and Spoke kitchen. It was great to enjoy the air conditioned area, with comfortable sofa, while the kids were kept busy outdoor.

The minimum spend is $30 per person before GST at Overflow Bar and you can also order extra food from Hub & Spoke Café on top of that.

It took a bit of extra time to locate the property, as the hotel's name differed from what was listed on Tiket.com and the signage was not very clear. Clearer identification would be helpful, especially for first-time guests.

The room and bathroom were clean and generally comfortable. However, throughout the stay, housekeeping service was minimal. Towels were replaced, but the room was not cleaned, and the bed was left unmade, which was a little disappointing.

The reception staff’s demeanor felt rather reserved, and a more welcoming attitude would have improved the overall experience.

On a positive note, the hotel is located in a quiet area, which is suitable for rest and relaxation. It may also be a convenient choice for Muslim travelers due to the surrounding amenities. However, for tourists new to Singapore, the location might be slightly less ideal as it is a bit removed from the city center and major attractions.

While there are some strengths, particularly in cleanliness and peacefulness, there is room for improvement in terms of service and guest communication.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-20T14:29:25.323409Z,Asmara Wati

However, I recently took my 7-year-old daughter to this new playground which was opened recently quiet near to the red bridge and sunrise bridge. I was really impressed with the design and thoughtfulness that went into it. The playground is suitable for children of all ages, from toddlers to school-age kids. There are several rope-based climbs, spinning wheels, and tunnels, as well as slides and a sand pit. My daughter had a blast exploring all the different structures. She especially loved the rope based climbing structures. Families visiting the bridge can take a small detour if kids want some fun.

I was also impressed with the safety features of the playground. There are soft fall surfaces under all the equipment, and the playground is fenced in to keep children safe. I felt very comfortable letting my daughter play although I supervise her.

Overall, I was very impressed with this playground. It's a great place for kids of all ages to have fun and get some exercise. I would definitely recommend it to other parents.

Here are some of the things I liked about the playground:

* It's well-designed and safe for children of all ages.
* There are a variety of activities to choose from, so kids of all interests can find something to enjoy.
* The playground is clean and well-maintained.
* It's located in a convenient location (next to the sunrise bridge), making it easy for families to get to.",en,2 years ago,2023-05-13T07:54:33.930750Z,Harish

My point is you want to sleep clean and don't think about bugs under your mattresses pay more. Even we were in hotel 81 on the other side of the street.

This hotel offers a budget-friendly option, which is a definite plus considering the current prices. The room I stayed in had a TV, and while the hotel is located a fair distance from the MRT, the bus service is quite convenient, taking around 40 minutes to an hour to reach the CBD.

However, there were several downsides to my stay. The hotel appeared to be quite dirty, and there was a noticeable curry-like odour, along with another lingering unpleasant smell in the entrance area. Upon arrival, the staff at the entrance didn't approach me for a full 15 minutes, and they weren't easily identifiable as staff members.

During my stay, an odd incident occurred where someone entered my room and left a wet promotional tissue on the bed. The room itself was basic, with only one power point that unfortunately had old style USB connectors, making it unusable for charging. While my room had a bathtub, it was stained with strange orange marks, making it unappealing to use without wearing slippers.

Additionally, there's a nearby sevel eleven which I'd advise avoiding. It's a tiny 2x3 square metre space with significantly overpriced items, such as a bottle of water for $5.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a cheap place to stay and can tolerate the cleanliness issues and inconvenient location (relative to the MRT), this hotel might suffice. However, if cleanliness and easy access to public transport are priorities, you might want to consider other options despite the higher cost.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-08T01:37:38.746710Z,Alex Z

Tried item C: Bitter Gourd with Egg soup ($4) + Dry Hor Fun ($1.50)
= $5.50 (Total) reasonable price.

Hor Fun (dry) with black sauce (mild sweetness), fried shallots, spring onions, mini pork lards (maybe chopped very small pc - you can ask for more if you like).
You can add more chilli paste or chopped chilli padi if you like more spicy kick 🔥 🥵  Shiok & Sweat! 💦

Bitter Gourd Soup MUST TRY!
Really generous ingredients like:
- thick & tender pork slices (maybe pork collar)
- minced pork (no fats surprisingly)
- pork balls (texture not hard when bite)
- brown strips (can someone enlighten me what it call?) thanks.
- bitter gourd not bitter (I'm a person who don't fancy bitter gourd, but it really hit my taste buds - good try for me!)

This soup really warms my heart and makes me feel missing my mum's hot soup...wow!

The last time I went around the same time, the situation was also similar - most of the stalls were closed too.

Can anyone enlighten me on why that is? I don’t think it’s due to low foot traffic at that hour. It feels more like a few stalls had slow business so they closed early. Then others probably saw that and followed suit, assuming the traffic is getting lesser.

Then as time goes by, when more customers come and see most of the stalls closed, they leave - which further reduces traffic even further. Then when the stall owners see all that - they feel their choice is justified in closing early, even though they might be contributing to the problem in the first place. The whole thing becomes like a kind of self-reinforcing feedback loop.

To me, it feels like there are still plenty of people who’d want to dine there at that time. Or am I missing something?

As for the food - some were nice and the stall owners friendly. The drink stall owner has attitude problem. The china noodles stall food is great.

This hawker centre seems like a good place to dine in at night, when its cooler, but sadly it doesn't seem to be open at that time anymore.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-04T10:36:31.713950Z,Jun Kai

However, the machine rejected all my tokens, and when I asked the staff for assistance, he said the machine was spoilt and BOTH machines couldn't be played. But there was no indications or signs that said the machine was unable to play. He just smiles and nods in agreement?!?! Is it so hard to put the black tap on?

I then went to the counter to request a refund, since there wasn't any other machine I would like to play. And the counter staff said no refunds for token.

But in the first place, I wouldn't have redrawn the token if the machine showed that it was unavailable. There was no tape, and the lights and wheels were spinning.

Why did your staff's negligence in doing their job cause me to need to bring home 50 tokens? Super upset hearing upon this, and your staff weren't exactly friendly either. Should i be thankful i only drawn 50 tokens out.

Century Square 19 June 2025-2130-2245hrs = Coin changing machine not working, cash exchange machine waited 30 mins upon frequent request to fix ignored. After playing one of the toy push displacement machine for an hour, managed to win the red stopper prize. I alerted this Indian maintenance staff (photo-without glasses, light facial stubble, stout built, 5'6"") several times at close range but he deliberately ignored me until I walked right up to him to respond. He snapped back in a hostile manner and replied "" WHAT ?!!"" I calmly told him I won the prize to collect and was shocked he angrily retorted, "" So, shake for it!"". I then firmly repeated to collect my prize. He then went to reset the machine and pass me the prize from the counter. I then calmly requested for his name for reference but again he ignored me. I insisted he provide his name and added that if he felt his hostile attitude was justified, why would he be reluctant to own up to his uncouth behavior. He then challenged me to go report on Facebook when I requested for his name again. He snapped back and instructed I just identify him as ""the Indian guy"". I informed him that there were more than few Indian staff there so his name was required. He then ignored me again. I then calmly snapped a facial photo of him for reference and he turned hostile questioning me several times why I took his photo. I simply smiled and replied, "" So?.. It's for your management."" I firmly stood my ground and paused for his possible retaliation. I definitely wouldn't have had hesitated to call the police had he dared made further threatening movements towards me.
Anyways, my 2 cents.. If any of your staff is unhappy working there, please tell them, like what locals say,  to stay home, shake legs, and don't work to avoid antagonizing good paying customers without cause. As for myself, I'm pretty done tolerating all your bad staff behavior and probably no longer patronize your franchise once I clear my balance tokens, since, from so many bad reviews, nothing seems to be rectified. Last year before closing hours, my bad, I left my pouch with cash filled, Credit cards, ID,.. Etc. wallet overnight at your machine and even calling the 1st  morning maintenance staff on opening hours to check. He kept informing nothing found and kept brushing off my concerns claiming very busy. Nevertheless, I personally rushed down to your CS branch to confirm with that Chinese morning staff and I even offered $100 reward to view the cctv. He refused but I demanded to view the cctv to trace the point of my own negligence or I'll call the police. He relented. Once it was clear the cctv showed the night staff found it, that morning staff miraculously revealed that my bag suddenly appeared and was found and placed under the cash register. It was not there before. I still kept my integrity and gave him the$100 reward to share with the honest Malay night staff , despite knowing I could have easily called the police on his intentions to keep my bag after viewing the cctv. So much for your staff professionalism. Do better.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-20T16:31:33.409930746Z,Kenzo Hideyo Saito

Initially, I was assisted by an Indian lady, who might be new and unfamiliar with the products. Wei Tian then stepped in to assist us. His patience and knowledge stood out as he explained the pros and cons of the 2 printer brands I was considering.

Despite there being no stock available in-store, Wei Tian went the extra mile to check stock at other outlets. He followed up, arranged for the printer to be delivered to my shop, and even guided my staff through the installation process.

This level of dedication and willingness to go above and beyond truly embodies excellent customer service. It's this kind of effort that leaves customers smiling and satisfied.

My mother pawned her gold and wish to retrieve them back while hospitalized during her last few months of her journey.
Ms EE is a well disciplined staff and executed her company policies without failure by charging us 1.5% for assignee to collect on behalf.

Otherwise i will need to drag my mother's hospital bed there in order for us to evade the excess charges of $8.xx Dollars.
What an outstanding company because of an excess $8.xx! If you’ve ever dreamed of being treated like a walking wallet rather than a human being, then congratulations—you’ve found your corporate soulmate. Their commitment to profit is truly admirable, especially when it comes at the delightful expense of basic compassion, Customer well-being, and, you know, human health.
Got a medical concern? Too bad! Their wellness program consists of ""Company Policies only"" (billed at $8.xx)
Their motto? ""Your health is your problem, but your money is ours."" Truly groundbreaking! Who needs ethics when you’ve got shareholder value?

So if you love being nickel-and-dimed while your well-being is treated as an optional extra, this is the company for you! A+ for greed, F for humanity.
Keep up the heartless work! 💰💀👏

So when I stumbled upon this gem - T2 Famous Fried Fish Soup at Foodies’ Clan, my belly couldn’t be happier! 😍 This cosy little food court has quirky decor that catches your eye, plus an outdoor garden perfect for a post-meal stroll. 🌿

The fish noodles is apparently a famous stall from Changi Airport Terminal 2. 😮 For just $6, I get a big bowl of noodles loaded with thick, fresh Batang fish, tons of cabbage, and slices of fried egg floating in a deliciously savory broth.

I’m definitely coming back for round two! 🍜✨

When planning my visit, I referred to the information available on Google and the signage on your clinic’s door, both of which stated your operating hours as 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM. Based on this, I arrived at the clinic at 11:45 AM to register, well within the stated hours. To my surprise, I was informed by the receptionist that the clinic had closed at 11:30 AM.

This inconsistency raises two concerns:
1.	Misinformation: The posted and advertised hours of operation are clearly inaccurate. This misleads patients and wastes their time.
2.	Receptionist’s Response: When I mentioned the posted hours, the receptionist provided no clear explanation, leaving me uncertain whether the information is outdated or if I was deliberately misinformed.

Accurate and transparent communication is essential for any healthcare provider, as patients often plan their visits around these details. I kindly request that you:
•	Update the operating hours on all public platforms and signage to reflect the correct schedule.
•	Ensure staff are well-informed and provide consistent information to patients.
•	Provide clarification on why I was told the clinic had closed earlier than the stated hours.

Store Location: Best Bedok Mall

Hi Team

On the National Day holiday, I visited your store in Bedok mall and saw a promotional poster outside stating that Bluetooth earphones were priced at SGD 8, and an air fryer was priced at SGD 28. I found the earphones to be a great deal, so I purchased five units as gifts for my family. I was still considering the air fryer at that time, so I went home without buying it.

Later in the day, I decided to return to the store to purchase the air fryer. However, when I inquired about it, I was told it was priced at the original SGD 78, and the promotional poster had been taken down. I explained clearly that I had seen the promotion in the morning and had even purchased the earphones from the same poster.

During this conversation, one Indian female staff member spoke to me in an extremely rude manner, repeatedly raising her voice and demanding that I show the receipt (which was at home), while refusing to check your sales system for my purchase record. Her tone was disrespectful and condescending, which made the experience very unpleasant.

Eventually, another male staff member came forward to apologise and explained that it was a staff mistake and that the promotion had ended earlier. However, the female staff member in question never apologised and left the scene entirely.

My requests are as follows:

Investigate the incident, including the removal of the promotional poster and the staff’s handling of the situation.

Provide proper service attitude training to the female staff member.

Review your internal promotion information management process to prevent future cases of misleading promotions and inconsistent pricing.

I completely understand that promotions may end or that mistakes may happen, but I cannot accept being spoken to in such an unprofessional and disrespectful manner. Customers come to your store to shop, not to be treated poorly.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-09T13:15:36.760208007Z,huiyee慧仪

We found the conditions completely unacceptable and left within 30 minutes of checking in. The photos online are very misleading — in person, the room feels cramped, poorly maintained, and unhygienic. The only surface we felt safe sitting on was our own suitcases.

What I really love here is the wide variety of drinks — especially their homemade soya milk,grass jelly and etc, all reasonably priced, plus they have a Buy 3 Get 1 Free! Their pastries are also pretty good and come with the same promotion. The staff are friendly and best of all — they’re open 24 hours!

Here are my top 3 go-to stalls at this coffee shop:

1. Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang
One of my favorite nasi lemak stalls in Singapore! Reasonably priced and generous portions. I'm not good with spicy food, so I usually ask them to switch the sambal to curry gravy 🤣 — but if you love spicy food, their signature ayam taliwang is a must-try!
Opening hours: Morning till 10PM

2. Yong Ji Roasted Delights
Their chicken rice is super fragrant, and the roasted chicken, pork, and duck are all delicious! What makes it stand out is the free herbal soup — it’s so flavorful, and that’s rare for chicken rice stalls in Singapore! Reasonably priced, great service, and the food tastes better than some restaurants.
Opening hours: Morning till 8PM

3. Ong Seafood (Zi Char Stall)
I often go for their Hor Fun, which is tasty, filling, and affordable. I haven’t tried their main dishes yet, but I really admire the hardworking stallholder — possibly the same person who runs the economy rice stall next door in the morning and then handles the zi char stall later on. He’s always friendly too.
Opening hours: Until 9PM

I used to come here around 11PM after work for supper, especially for the nasi lemak and zi char, but unfortunately they now close earlier — such a pity.

Hope this little guide helps anyone exploring good eats around Tampines West! :)",en,a month ago,2025-07-03T13:45:33.698587450Z,Wei Kang

I would like to express my appreciation to Ms. Eileen Wong and Ms. Jenny Li from Courts. Eileen has never disappointed me, she is pleasant, diligent, and honest, with a strong customer-centric approach. Her patience is truly her greatest asset, especially in helping me monitor affordable prices over time.

As I am moving to a smaller unit, I realised I needed more storage than expected, particularly for bed linen, duvets, and towels collected over the years. Eileen’s assistance was invaluable in helping me find a practical yet quality solution.

Courts’ promotion was very attractive, offering greater value through discounts compared to free gifts. After much consideration, I decided on a storage bed paired with the MaxCoil Zencore Pocketed Spring Mattress – Firm. This range features:

Silver Ion 3D Mesh Technology – keeps cool and fresh all night, even on warm nights.

Antibacterial Silver Ion Protection – inhibits bacterial growth and neutralises odours.

X-Shaped Honeycomb Support Structure – provides targeted pressure relief and supports natural spinal alignment.

Courts adopts different procedures, and Ms. Jenny Li assisted me with my payment. She was pleasant, helpful with my queries, and ensured the transaction process was smooth. The delivery date arrangement was fast and efficient, making the entire experience hassle-free.

At my age, comfort and proper support are essential, and after Eileen’s clear explanation of the key features and benefits, I felt confident in my choice. I am grateful for both Eileen’s professionalism and dedication, and Jenny’s helpfulness and efficiency in ensuring everything went smoothly from purchase to delivery.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-12T13:57:30.464373121Z,Dennis Lim

How will the customer know they need to tell the cashier upfront on the discount items or HOW MANY discount item they have chosen?? The tone and the way she spoke as though it was our mistake for not telling her upfront?? And keep telling us to separate the wet and dry.  Hello! Is not our job, right?

All in all, a pleasant place to stay.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-08T23:02:28.435674Z,Robert Li

From the moment I stepped near the entrance, I had a bad feeling. The place looked filthy and poorly maintained. As soon as I entered the lobby, I was hit with a strong, fishy, unpleasant smell that only got worse upstairs.

The first room they gave me was crawling with cockroaches and ants – literally everywhere. I immediately went to the receptionist and asked for a room change. Shockingly, the second room was even worse. The aircon was broken, the bathroom was disgusting, and the pest problem was just as bad, if not worse. It felt more like a horror movie set than a hotel room.

Honestly, it was a nightmare to stay even for an hour. I cannot believe a hotel like this is allowed to operate in Singapore, a city known for cleanliness. There's clearly zero pest control or hygiene standards here, and yet they have the audacity to charge SGD 90 per night? For what exactly? Roaches and sleepless nights?

As you step inside, you're immediately enveloped by an atmosphere of refined elegance and sophisticated comfort. The lounge's design, with its warm wood tones, sleek marble surfaces, and plush furnishings, creates an inviting ambiance that perfectly balances modern aesthetics with a sense of timeless class.
The decor is thoughtfully curated, featuring contemporary artwork and subtle lighting that enhances the overall sense of exclusivity. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer panoramic views of the airport, allowing natural light to flood the space and creating an airy, open feel. The attention to detail in the lounge's layout ensures that whether you're seeking a quiet corner to work or a more social setting, there's a perfect spot for every traveler.
The customer service at the Qantas International First Lounge is nothing short of impeccable. From the moment you're greeted at the entrance, the staff demonstrates a level of attentiveness and professionalism that truly sets this lounge apart. They strike the perfect balance between being readily available to assist with any request and allowing guests to enjoy their privacy and relaxation.
Now, let's dive into the culinary experience, which is undoubtedly a highlight of the lounge. The journey begins with an impressive selection of cocktails that showcase creativity and premium ingredients. The GQF2 Cocktail is a standout, featuring Four Pillars Rare Dry Gin, Fever Tree tonic, and an innovative Aperol ice cube, garnished with orange. This drink is a refreshing twist on a classic, with the Aperol ice cube slowly melting to create an evolving flavor profile throughout the sipping experience.
Equally impressive is the Passionfruit & Jalapeno Daiquiri, a bold combination of jalapeno rum, passionfruit, and lemon. This cocktail perfectly balances sweet and spicy notes, creating a vibrant and memorable drink that awakens the palate.
Moving on to the food, the prawn wontons with black vinegar and chili make for an excellent starter. These delicate parcels burst with flavor, the sweetness of the prawns complemented beautifully by the tangy black vinegar and a hint of heat from the chili.
The star of the show, however, is undoubtedly the Signature Laksa with crayfish, rice noodles, and bean sprouts. This dish exemplifies the lounge's commitment to offering a taste of local cuisine elevated to first-class standards. The rich, aromatic broth is perfectly balanced, while the generous portion of crayfish adds a touch of luxury to this Singaporean classic.
To finish, the cheese platter and olives provide a sophisticated end to the meal. The selection of cheeses is well-curated, offering a range of textures and flavors that pair wonderfully with the accompanying condiments.
Overall, the Qantas International First Lounge in Singapore offers a dining experience that rivals many high-end restaurants, all within the comfort of an exceptionally designed and serviced airport lounge. It's a testament to Qantas' commitment to providing a truly premium experience for their first-class passengers.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-17T02:27:00.085280Z,Sam M

My child was not used to seeing a doctor and fussed, but Dr Tan was able to engage her first using stickers, then with items / decals around the doctor’s room. By the end of the visit, she calmed down and was able to say bye to the Dr.

Dr Timothy Tan was also able to explain the uses of medication and how to administer them effectively for children. I liked that as compared to the PD clinic nearby, he did not excessively prescribe medication. The cost was also abt 40% cheaper, can be paid with CHAS subsidies and CDA NETS.

He ensured I was stable and closely monitored me, taking my blood pressure, checking my temperature and making sure I stayed hydrated. In between seeing other patients, he continually checked on me to ensure I was okay before allowing me to leave.

His dedication and attentiveness were remarkable and his team of nurses was equally impressive. 💯 They worked together seamlessly, doing everything they could to relieve my discomfort and provide reassurance during a stressful time. Apart from that my dad also visits Dr. Eugene to his lower back pain and he said he will not go to any other clinic.

Yi Xing is an amazing stall that deserves more recognition! Unfortunately, they’re not listed on Google Maps yet, but they are absolutely worth seeking out. I recently tried their Koka noodles/ 可口面/ KKM (both the regular and seafood versions), and they were really good—The flavors are rich, comforting, and satisfying.
Their porridge is another standout—so flavorful and perfect for a hearty meal. They also serve authentic Vietnamese dishes like pho, and since the stall is run by Vietnamese owners. They even offer a variety of other dishes to cater to all tastes.

I rarely eat my food before taking photos, but the food was so tantalising that I could not resist taking a bite before taking a pic!

Pros:

+ Roasted meat 烧肉 was fatty, crunchy, juicy and oh-so-tender! A lot roast pork tends to get too dry, from too much time spent in the oven. But the way they roast their pork retains a certain juiciness and succulent-ness to it. Def reccomend!

+Roasted duck 烧鸭 was nice. The skin is coloured deeply, and you can tell a lot of effort was spent roasting it. It was rather bony for my liking, but I think the meat part of it was quite decent.

-The coffeeshop itself is rather poorly renovated😢.",en,2 years ago,2023-01-07T05:26:16.253787Z,Hung Hao

Food was affordable and good. Fast forward to today, things have changed. Many of the old stalls are gone and food is not that affordable now. Of course this does not mean that this coffeeshop has nothing to offer to the hungry diner. This coffeeshop has 3 stalls that have long queues. The roti prata, chicken rice and fishball noodles stalls. The roti prata is crispy and always cooked upon order. They have never given me pre-cooked pratas. The chicken rice on the other hand is pretty average, and I have never understood their popularity. Maybe its an acquired taste as they have been serving chicken rice in the area for years. The fishball noodles is rather spicy, but the chilli is good. If your taste buds can't handle spicy food, it is better that you ask for less chilli. Overall, this is a pretty small coffeeshop that serves average food, with the roti prata and fishball noodles standing above the crowd. One thing to take note is that their coffee is really expensive as their cups are small. Their new cup size is about half their old cups(the glass kind).",en,in the last week,2025-08-23T21:28:22.688523098Z,Hatsune Miku

Googled and found Soon Kim Motor nearby and open early at 8am! Drove there slowly and workshop is already opened. Surprised that it's manned by an old couple. Uncle is very fast and experienced and removed & patched the tyre in no time. Aunty will help Uncle to keep the equipments after he was finished with them. Aunty also guided my car to reverse out when I drive off. Very nice and sweet couple. Not a lot of workshops opened so early.

Will definitely be back.",en,4 months ago,2025-04-08T11:18:42.467482Z,Happy Bird

Service: once u paid money, settle down, then it’s self-service. No menu in the room to order food so basically u have to order via the cashier out there. The food we ordered is small in portion, taste average and kinda not worth it. But they have an interesting item on the menu: Fish Skin in rojak sauce. Not bad.

Ben was knowledgeable and super patient and helpful despite my limited knowledge on the product. His team (another gentleman and a lady) were also super helpful and friendly. Ben was helping to install the Microsoft Office pack and somehow it took a while to complete. Ben had to take his dinner break before the evening crowd began and his colleague stand in to help assist. The lady colleague was also coming over to offer small chat to ensure im not bored by th waiting. The team also brought a stool so i can sit and wait. The cohesive team speaks alot on Ben's leadership. The after-sales service have also been excellent. I had to go back with the laptop to get a few clarification and Ben was again very patient and helpful in testing the functionality to ensure it is working well for me. Fantastic experience with Chellenger at Bedok Mall despite the laptop I purchased was a very basic one under S$800.

Even though they are often understaffed, they are always kind, patient, and professional. They have never been rude to me, and they never doubt me when I report an issue, like when coins do not dispense. If there is any delay in assistance, they always apologise sincerely.

In particular, I want to highlight the cashier lady with spectacles who has been so kind to me since I started visiting about two months ago to destress from work. She patiently taught me how the membership system works and explained how the coin dispensing works.

There is also a very tall male staff member with spectacles who is extremely hardworking — he constantly goes the extra mile without being asked. It’s clear that the staff here work very hard, probably under tough conditions with long hours and modest pay.

I hope the management recognises and appreciates their dedication. Because of these wonderful staff members, I will continue to support this outlet. Thank you for making each visit such a positive experience!",en,4 months ago,2025-04-28T14:08:53.711698Z,Cheryl Foo

The place is airy and spacious, which makes it comfortable even during the lunch rush.

It isn't as big as I expected, but had a decent number of stalls. Some of them are closed, and it's a Sunday night at around 8pm, so I'm not sure if they close early or have stopped operating.

The place is relatively new and hence is quite clean, but it's actually very warm to dine here. The ceiling fans installed helped to ventilate the air, but barely created any wind.

They have quite a few stalls that are chains, such as Danlao, and some that are second outlets, such as the White Lor Mee.

Female old aunty - very rude (  I told her I don want milk to put on to the mango ice dessert. She raise her voice mention all ice dessert must put milk. Instead of she need to ask the client( me) if I want ; and not  I  had to remind her not to put. Beside there is another helper clever to say all dessert is a must of put milk on top of it. What  kind of service is this? Please  kindly share what is going on here? Is this the service your company employees treat your client in such a way? I didn’t want to investigate further at that time. I am quite annoyed of the way your staff reply in such a rude way by raise voice tone. The environment is such a nice place n with your staff behaviour really spoilt my mood . So much a difference between the dessert uncle n the dessert old aunt n the other helper .
Please look on your staff behaviour n hope there have to be improvement.

Just wanted to say I had a great experience at the Mister Mobile in Marine Parade! I was a bit worried at first about the phone's authenticity and warranty when I got my new S24 Ultra.

But, turns out it's a real, brand new Samsung phone with a full year of warranty.

The staff were awesome, especially with the mobile repair stuff. Plus, their prices are all out in the open on their website, no surprises.

Totally recommend them if you're looking for a new phone in Singapore (Android, iPhone, whatever!).

Thanks guys, keep up the good work!",en,a month ago,2025-07-11T01:36:30.993410602Z,Arul Honest Raj

Skip those franchises coffeeshop and breakfast cafes, because here is one place that you will be back for more 😁😁😁

Starting from the Wanton mee, they have been here for many years. Judging from the number of people queuing and buying, it is a great tasting plate of wantom mee. This lady has perfected her cooking of noodles and made her wanton awesome😍. Drizzle in the black sauce, add some chilli or ketchup if you want or green chilli. I have this wanton mee every now and then. Worth to come back and have it again.

Uncle Sim stall is one that you must try. His Mee Siam, Mee Rebus and and Longtong is one of the best. Having being on some food vareity programmes and recommended by other food reviewers, his food is definitely worth to try.

The Prata shop is also another stall been here a number of years. When you see the guy flip the dough effortlessly, pan fry the prata and present you a hot, crispy plate of prata with either fish or dhal curry, I would buy them in an instance! For prata lovers, this is a must go place! Feel free to ask him to have your prata more crispy if you want.

Next to the Prata stall would be the Malay Food. Don't underestimate this makcik behind the shop. Although she seems to be a one woman show, she makes great sambal chilli, cooks an aromatic nasi lemak, fry the items malay style and to me, her mee Goreng are nice! She also sells kueh and the all time favourite curry puffs. Those potato or sardine curry puffs, crispy on the edges, hot and fresh on the inside.

The vegetarian stall is new but these folks has been in this estate for quite long. Due to rent increase at the previous premises, they moved here. Everything you see here at their stall are personally cooked by them. The classic Vegetarian breakfast set is one that stands out. Generous portion of either beehoon, kwayteow or noodles, mock Charsiew, stir fry cabbage, mock goose, and crispy zai-er! Add on other items if you need. Taste is nostalgic and nice!

Next to the vegetarian stall is this ever popular and forever popular, economical bee hoon. If you are a heavy breakfast person, this is one of the stall that you should aim. Start off with a choice of bee hoon, Kway teow or noodles, go free on their extensive sides to add into your carb base. From fried chicken wings, fish fillet, luncheon meat, tofu or Taiwan Sausage, sunny side up eggs and more! I love their fried chicken cutlet. 😍😍 Sometimes I got carried away and added 5 items. Sinful meal but we all love this kind of food.

Save this place for your next breakfast meal. I guarantee you will be spilt for choice and be confused by the vareity of food offered here. Be early, beacuse especially weekend, the tables are full house.",en,3 years ago,2022-06-27T00:35:56.105289Z,Benjamin Tong

1. She told a Myanmar helper her Thanaka (paste on the face) was ""scaring"" her customers (nobody said or reacted in any way about it) and that to use it only at night, at home.
2. On another instance, she repeatedly hard sell a customer with the pau/siew mai(s) that were left. She added that she would have to purchase the remaining few and consume them if nobody buys it. And, eating at night will cause her to have difficulty sleeping. You could feel that the (obviously irritated) customer bought only because she was pushy about it and told her son to ask the mum(paying customer) to purchase it.

I had an extremely poor experience at the Marhaba Lounge in Terminal 3, Changi Airport.

Despite asking whether vegetarian food was available, I was bluntly told there was only one vegetarian dish — which turned out to be completely false. There were several other items on the buffet clearly free of meat, but when I pointed this out, the staff dismissed them, saying ""those have onion and garlic, so not vegetarian."" Since when did onion and garlic stop being considered vegetarian? That’s cultural insensitivity at best and deliberate misdirection at worst.

On top of that, the coffee machine was not working, and no alternative was offered — quite surprising for a premium lounge.

But the worst part was the attitude of the staff: rude, dismissive, and at moments bordering on racist behavior. There was clear disparity in how different guests were treated, and it left a very unpleasant taste — far worse than the food.

For a lounge that promises hospitality and comfort, this was an unacceptable experience. I hope Marhaba seriously reviews their training and service standards — especially when it comes to cultural awareness, basic courtesy, and treating all guests with equal respect.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-17T11:46:53.018204911Z,Vinay Patel

◻️Service and Hospitality : The staffs are efficient, very swift in handling the cleaning process, friendly, well behaved and helpful.

◻️interior and ambiance : Interior is contemporary. Clean and sleek in design. Soothing colour theme made this lounge very relaxing. The dining tables are perfect to have the meals comfortably and went very well with the soothing theme. The view of the runway makes the experience more pleasant and memorably enjoyable.

The restrooms have shower facilities where Muslim travellers can perform wudu before praying. If I’m not mistaken there’s a prayer space nearby.

First I wanted to try their grilled beef steak. Went to the meat counter and was told only 1 brand of beef is allowed though many more beef steak options available.

Followed the instructions and picked just about 500g of fish fillet and beef steak. Went to the cashier and was told cooking fees of $8 ea for fish and meat, cannot be counted together.

Frustrated, I returned the beef and picked 2 more boxes of fish fillet. Went to counter and was told fish fillet too small (2 fingers width) cannot be grilled. Immediately I told them if there's so many restrictions, why not just place all the grill-able stuff under one counter for consumers to choose. Asked to speak to the manager on duty but not available.

In the end, I just bought a $4 handroll to eat. While making payment at the same cashier, cashier then tell me if I still want those 2 packs of fillet as the other chef is able to grill!

Atrocious! Whether a piece of meat can be cooked depends on the staff on duty? What more, if you can cook prawns and sotongs which are smaller in size, what's wrong with the fish fillet .

Please get your operations and act right.",en,2 years ago,2023-07-13T12:33:03.168980Z,Linus Neo

The place was buzzing with life — smoky grills, sizzling woks, and the mouthwatering aroma of barbecued seafood filling the air. Finding a seat took a little patience, but once settled, it was game on.

We went for all the classics: BBQ stingray with spicy sambal, Hokkien mee drenched in rich prawn stock, satay with perfectly charred edges, and a towering glass of sugarcane juice to wash it all down. Every stall seemed to have its own crowd of loyal fans, and honestly, the quality here explains why. The flavours were bold, portions generous, and everything tasted fresh off the grill or wok.

Chomp Chomp isn’t the place for quiet dining — it’s noisy, lively, and unapologetically bustling. But that’s exactly what makes it such a Singapore food icon. If you’re visiting with friends or family, come hungry, be ready to share plates, and just soak in the hawker culture at its finest.",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-14T14:54:52.473792932Z,Crumpled Nomad

I just wanted to give a heads-up to the gaming community, especially those who frequent Paco Funworld and similar arcades. There's a regular adult patron who has been causing some frustration by hogging the Maximum Midnight Tune 6 machines. He shows up around the early afternoon, loads credits into four separate machines, and then only plays on one, essentially blocking others from getting a turn.

I’ve had to ask staff to step in before at a katong outlet, and while they’ve been helpful in clearing one machine, he has since moved to Stadium outlet. His reasoning that he’s ""trying to earn credit score"" doesn’t really seem to justify taking up multiple machines when others are waiting to play.

I think it’s important for both the staff and the arcade-goers to be aware of this kind of behavior. If you see him doing this again, it would be great if action could be taken to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to enjoy the game.

Just wanted to share and spread the word. Let’s keep things fun and fair for everyone!",en,2 weeks ago,2025-08-13T15:29:53.257172819Z,ema tan

Unacceptable long wait time! Visited this clinic and consulted with Dr Kumar.

We had a scheduled appointment to the clinic at in the evening, ended up waiting for close to another hour or so.

Extreme extent of poor time management I have ever seen from a clinic. Usually its 10-15 max from the time of appointment.

During consult, we also noticed that he was being distracted with his phone. Made us question if it was just inconvenient or a blatant disrespect to us patients’ time. Disrupted the rest of my evening scheduled plans just for this.

However the only possible saving grace was that counter staff were polite and we can notice that they were trying their best to manage our frustrations, but it will be unfair to take it out on them as they are and should not be responsible for this. Apparently, this doctor was new.

A simple glance around, in fact, we weren’t the only frustrated souls within the clinic.

Issue here clearly lies with how things are being managed BTS. Management ought to seriously look into these flow processes with appointments. Your poor staff can only answer to decisions that weren’t made by them. Its understandable that consults shouldn’t be rushed, but time management by the doctor can be vastly improved.

To anyone that is looking to come here, I strongly suggest you be prepared. Otherwise, simply unacceptable for us.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-22T01:34:20.032919908Z,Devin Ooi

Learn how to take constructive criticism and treat your patients with respect and empathy. This would probably be my last time going there
but very good experience for me to read the reviews before deciding to go anywhere. Taught me a valuable lesson to only go to my regular clinics.
Its not that hard to use the time wisely to improve the service by learning to take feedback instead of trying to cover bad attitudes and bad behaviour. God forbid i express my opinion in a free country and google reviews are all based on personal experience so who are you to judge me?
I tried to gentle parent, but how to defame yall when your clinic had no reputation to begin with?
my family and i tried to be understanding but if we all got the same treatment from you that day then what do you expect?

The clinic staff were generally courteous, and the clinic manager was especially helpful and professional. However, the doctor’s medical approach was concerning. For a minor skin allergy, I was prescribed three different topical steroids — an excessive approach for a mild condition. In a separate visit for an eye irritation , I was prescribed three types of eye drops, including antibiotics, without a clear justification.

Most troubling was the doctor’s tendency to exaggerate risks — warning me I could lose my vision or hearing, which felt medically ungrounded given the symptoms. When I sought clarification, he responded with defensiveness rather than reassurance or explanation.

Each visit cost approx SGD 200+, largely due to unnecessary prescriptions. This kind of overtreatment reflects questionable medical judgment and raises ethical concerns.

Enough ingredients and the soup is good ( the chilli powder is quite spicy so dont add too much).  I ordered to prawn bee hoon dried version and the bee hoon preparation was just right i.e. not soggy .  Overall I give it a 5 -star  rating considering the pricing.

What was better, to my surprise, was the vegetables which held their ground to the sweetness I tasted in HK.
The char siew is nice with good char, good blend of both meat and fats which I enjoy in such a cut.

Unfortunately, I left feeling quite disappointed due to unpleasant service during my visit.
Upon entering the store, I noticed the layout and product selection were decent, but what struck me immediately was the lack of customer service. Not a single employee greeted me or offered assistance—something I’ve come to expect when shopping in retail settings. I wandered the aisles for quite some time, searching for the charging cord on my own. While I appreciate the opportunity to browse without feeling pressured, a simple acknowledgment or offer of help would have made a world of difference.
Despite being visibly in need of assistance, no staff member attempted to check in on me or offer help. Eventually, I had to awkwardly flag down an employee who seemed preoccupied, behind the cashier only for them to respond with a quick and disinterested response in a sarcastic tone.
The lack of engagement made my shopping experience feel impersonal and frustrating. In a time where good customer service is essential, this outlet fell short.

🟦 The screen is 14 metres tall and 17 metres wide, making it one of the largest digital installations in any airport.

❇️ What makes it even more magical is how the waterfall reacts to movement and changes throughout the day.

🔵 It’s not just a mere LED screen — it is immersive, like nature and technology merged into one peaceful moment amid the hustle and bustle of the airport. ✳️The sound of flowing water enhances the calming effect.

🔵 I do feel this is a must-see if you're passing through Terminal 2, even if you're not flying.

If you’re looking for strong massages to ease the knots in your backs, relieve tension headaches and drain lymph nodes (not that i know a lot about it), I dare say this is the place to go to.

The massage isn’t for the faint hearted though. My therapist did a very strong massage but because I’ve had aches and pains from repetitive stress on many areas, the one hour gave me tremendous relief and I slept really well after.

Did a little test to check the blockage of my meridian points (tried it a week ago and couldn’t achieve the steps required, suggesting blockage of my meridian in the head but this morning I was able to do so albeit with a little bit of difficulty)

Pls take time to read our experience.

1. The location is quite far from major tourist spots like Sentosa, Chinatown, and even the airport.
2. The owner is friendly, but the staff unapproachable.
3. Our main issue occurred on our last night at the hotel. It was raining—not too heavily, just the kind where you can still go out with an umbrella. However, when we checked outside our room, water was already dripping and starting to flood the hallway. Since there was no gap between the room and the hall, the water could easily seep in. We had to pack all our belongings in our luggage to prevent them from getting wet.
4. That same night, around midnight, we heard a fire alarm! We were exhausted and initially didn’t realize what the sound was. But then we heard people on our floor talking. When we checked outside, we saw guests preparing to evacuate via the stairs. We didn’t panic at first because we had no idea where the fire was, but we still followed the others and left the room.
5. The emergency exit (stairwell) was extremely narrow—only one person could fit at a time. There was no ventilation, no windows, and a lot of obstructions, including cleaning tools, a clothesline, plywood, etc.
6. When we reached the ground floor, firefighters and other guests were already there. We waited for almost three hours, yet no one explained what had happened. When we tried asking, they simply told us to wait aside. They didn’t even check whether all the guests had evacuated safely. We knew there were seniors, pregnant women, and children in the building, but we had no idea if they had made it out.
7. The firefighters left, but we were still standing outside, waiting for an explanation. The only two staff members at the front desk couldn’t speak English, so they couldn’t explain anything to us. All they said was, “Everything’s okay, you can go back.”
8. Back in our room, we were all clueless and debated whether to transfer to another hotel. Since it was already our last night, we decided to just try to sleep. However, around 5 AM, ANOTHER FIRE ALARM WENT OFF!
Without hesitation, we grabbed our luggage and rushed down more than five flights of stairs.
9. When we reached the ground floor, there were no firefighters this time. We asked the front desk what was going on, and one staff member casually said, ""They told me to press the alarm as a test to check if it's still working, so I did.""
Like, BRO, WHY ARE YOU TESTING THE ALARM AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED?
WHY DIDN’T YOU INFORM US FIRST?! Imagine the fear and panic we felt. Right then and there, we booked a different hotel far from that area.
So again, we absolutely do NOT recommend this hotel.",en,5 months ago,2025-03-28T23:42:31.194384Z,choi joyomo

Now they have a young doctor who seems like has not much experience and consultation is not so good. I went there twice in 4 weeks but 1 symptom after another from cough to phlegm to sore throat, even prescribed me anti-biotic, but of no use. Same type of medication given as previously that perhaps not so good. I would rather spend the money at polyclinic with better doctors and consultation. The only plus point is waiting time super fast maybe because no proper consultation given and was chop chop. I am staying at Marine Drive, with few clinics at my area but yet i went to Faith because of past good experiences with experienced doctors they have. Now i m not returning there anymore. I hope Faith bring back the older doctors who are of more experience and give out better consultation and advice.
If a experienced doctor told me, not to worry, I can accept that. But if a young doctor tell me, not sure and didn’t tell me much or any advice, i better learn from YouTube for better advice.

Main complaint = bad service and filth.
PROS:
1) The location is pretty good. It takes less than 10 minutes to get to Paya Lebar MRT station and the PLQ mall. There are tons of food options around the area, and there’s even a convenience store by the entrance of the hotel.
2) The room we had was pretty spacious. We had lots of space to mobilize easily and open our luggage.

CONS:
1) The service is not very good here. I have multiple experiences to support my argument. FIRST, the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were not greeted at all by the receptionist (we greeted him, and there was no response) who seemed Asian and a bit old, with a frowny, annoying face. The first thing he said was, “All passports (in a rude, commanding intonation).” No good morning, no “how are you doing?”. At first I thought, oh, he must be tired since it was midnight and a graveyard shift. But I realized that this should NOT be an excuse. In the tons of hotels we’ve stayed at in the past, even at midnight, we are always greeted. It’s basic customer service. It wouldn’t hurt to say good morning or SMILE at least. SECOND, we specifically asked for our room to be cleaned and for the bedsheets, towels, etc. to be replaced (we hung the tag on the doorknob). However, when we came back, it was not cleaned at all. Nothing was replaced or changed. We called the front desk afterwards to clean our room. They did not apologize at all for their shortcoming, and all they said was, “okay we will send housekeeping [end of call].” It took about 1.5 hours for them to arrive. However, the housekeeping staff who helped us throughout our stay was the one polite staff in this entire hotel. This staff helped us with our requests, and was very helpful. THIRD, we kinda felt like ghosts throughout our stay. Whenever we entered or exited, the front desk staff just continued gossiping and chatting while staring at their computers, completely ignoring us. When we checked out, they did not thank us for staying with them. Maybe it was a certain batch of staff? Idk.
2) There were some large brown spots of dirt on the bathtub. It looked like it wasn’t cleaned for a while. It was kinda disgusting, as it looked like it could possibly be💩.
3) There were inconsiderate guests shouting and yelling at the hallway at night, making it quite difficult to relax/sleep.

Hmmm, mainly, it seems like Hotel 81 Tristar has a problem with a certain batch of front desk staff. Consider training these guys to at least have some basic customer service skills. This hotel has potential due its pros, but consider solving your cons. Would’ve wanted to stay here again especially due to its location, but the cons made us not want to stay here again.",en,a month ago,2025-07-17T12:42:10.178450348Z,ConSTANtine The Man

They delivered a faulty washer dryer which immediately errored upon being plugged in for the first time. Firstly, they (incorrectly) placed the blame on our plug socket, which had worked perfectly fine with the old washer (and which we then had to replace at our own cost). The machine still errored, confirming that the machine itself was faulty. Rather than immediately replacing it for a working unit like any reputable company would do, given they'd supplied a faulty product, they insisted that an Electrolux serviceman visited to confirm the fault first (and to 'repair it' which we refused given it was meant to be a brand new unit). This took 2 more days. Technician confirmed the fault was with the unit. Then took another 3 days to replace as they refused to send a replacement out as a priority. Meant we had to wait over a week for a working washing machine, as they removed our old one on Day 1.

They give you a decent price, and then re-quote a low price during actual transaction ( they make you wait for hours as they “check” the gadgets).

I clearly communicated the state and No of years used as well problems and was given a price. I was then asked to come and drop it at their office. But after you get there and they go through almost 2 hours of checking I was  re-quoted a ridiculous price.   Not sure if they expected me to lose patience and just agree to that price. As the other reviewer said a very good tactic of baiting customers and wasting their time. I finally sold it at another place at a rate very close to what I was expecting.

I knew Steven personally as an acquaintance and was initially hesitance to let him do the repair. I was worried that it would be quite awkward if the repair was not done properly. However, after I read about his good reviews, I decided to try his service. I got the spare parts from eBay and the repairs were done in a few days after the parts arrived.

The clinic is conveniently located within the mall, making it easily accessible, especially for residents around Fernvale.

The front-desk staff were courteous and efficient, and the waiting time was reasonable given the weekend crowd. The attending doctor was professional, clear in communication, and took the time to explain the diagnosis and treatment options thoroughly. I appreciated the multilingual capability of the staff, which made the consultation more comfortable.

The clinic environment was clean and well-maintained, and the digital registration process was smooth. However, I would suggest a bit more clarity in the follow-up instructions and perhaps a more proactive approach in addressing patient concerns during peak hours.

Overall, I would recommend Etern Medical Clinic for its convenience, professionalism, and quality of care.",en,a month ago,2025-07-05T10:57:29.578375417Z,Mudit Mittal

Heard that their nasi lemak is famous and indeed it’s good. Has quite a fair bit of Muslim stalls, follow by bbq and satay stalls.

A few I tried like their western food (I assumed only one in the hawker), price is cheaper end, like chicken chop rice for $5. Ang Teck lim drink stall - pineapple drink is good. Dessert stall ice soursop soso only but also cheap at $2. Warong Statay selling one of the cheaper mutton statay within the hawker at $0.90 each but sorry to say not to my liking I would say.

Update 7 January 2025
Had the chicken rice. I ordered the set with the steam chicken and the boiled vegetable for $7.50. The chicken was OK but nothing like the kampong chicken which has firm and chewy skin. The one here is tender without skin. The chilli and minced ginger sauce is very good. Boiled vegetable is done well. The complementary old cucumber soup is nice.
Upgrade this foodcourt to 3 stars.
===≈===================

Been here previously but didn't have the chance to try the dim sum. After having the bread and egg set, decided to try the siew mai at an affordable price of $2. For the set, the egg yolk was very over cooked. Also would prefer the toast to be more crispy. Coffee is good. The most disappointing was the siew mai. It was soft and mushy. Really, this was the worst siew mai that I had ever eaten. I hope they will change the supplier.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-14T05:16:50.362917Z,Jacob TAN

- frequently empty, better to come as an invitee of one of the staff who will sit and drink with you.

SELLER WILL GOUGE YOU FOR MORE $$$ AFTER QUOTATION***  I got in contact with YeoBuild HomeStore via their WhatsApp chat for some help to replace my water heater that had started leaking. I asked for advice on whether I should downsize my water heater, which they helped me with. I also sent them a video of where the water heater was located and asked for a quote on how much it would cost for the replacement unit + installation. They quoted me a price that I agreed with - it was $312 for the replacement heater, and $400 for installation above a false ceiling. The sales person then directed me to their website where I could place the order, which I proceeded to do. The sales person also advised that they would be able to come and install the water heater in 2 days time. However, on the day before installation, they advised that they could not obtain the replacement unit and told me to wait. A few days later, they called and said that they needed to do a pre-installation site visit, and that this would cost an extra $60 or something as a call out fee. After the site visit, they said they would tell me how much more it would cost to install! I told them that the price quoted to me was for the replacement unit and installation - , but they didn't care. They said that because of this and that, that it would cost an extra $1000+ to install the unit! Because I did not agree to the extra cost, they cancelled the sale. What is the purpose of the $400 installation fee? Now I am left without hot water until I can find someone else to supply and install the unit.

I even asked where can I get the phone near to my place and she help me out as well...really appreciate it all.

Lite Mobile (Boon Keng Branch) even made a reservation so that when I get there they have my phone and color I wanted and it was really a great job because even the guy who assisted me was very friendly and suggested shock casing and screen protector so it was like package a one stop shop. To my surprise the casing and the screen protector has a warranty for 6months.

My bestie also wanted to buy her iPhone 16promax in Lite Mobile as they also have great discounts as well.

On the positive side, the dumplings and minced pork were decent – probably the only redeeming part of the meal.

They will explain to me the root cause of my pain while massaging for me. Jessen will even recommend me to do certain exercise to strength my muscle around my knee area. The condition of my knee has been improving after visiting them.

Highly recommended for everyone to visit them to ease your tension and ache on your body. But please call in advance, to make an appointment with them, to avoid any disappointment. I am sure, they are able to make you feel better after each session of massaging.

I hope the same will not happen to others (beside doctor and nurses)

1. System failure; we took a queue number via system app but when we reached the clinic at 2 pm, we were told that the queue number was not registered. We had to wait for 9 patients before our turn with my sick 1 year old despite taking a queue number which we took in advance.

2. Lack of empathy; when explained that my one year old is sick and we hope to get our original queue or at least see the doctor earlier. The reply is 'theres nothing we can do and you will need to follow the queue (9 patients before us)

3. Poor solution solving; when requested for a solution, the nurse finally helped me to book an appointment time for 2.45 pm. We didn't manage to see the doctor at appointment time as well. Waited for an one hour until 3 pm and we were the 2nd last patient at that time.

4. No phlegm medicine; although it is a PaedsENGAGE doctor/clinic but the clinic did not have the basic (in my opinion) medicine for children.",en,11 months ago,2024-09-23T20:08:37.048913Z,FaiTh Lim

The first 3 sessions with our original PT Shane was okay, but her 4th session was done by a MSK therapist Natasha, which I had not consented to (and my preference was for her to be seen by a PT).  On the evening of the massage following the 4th session, my mum developed brusies over her entire leg from the massage and suffered from intense pain that did not improve even after 4 days. We had to bring her to a doctor for assessment and was told that she would require 2 weeks to recover from the pain caused by the tissue massage.

We informed the clinic about her experience. However, there was no apology, MSK therapist Natasha denied all responsibilities, and the clinic claims that there was ""no evidence that the pressure was too strong"" even though there were solid evidence of the bruises.

There are serious concerns because my mum was seen by a different provider, which I did not agree to, and charged the rate for physiotherapy treatment, then suffered from a poorly executed massage session. This is very dishonest. Overall, I do not recommend this clinic at all, given the lack of accountability and poor follow-up after a bad experience.

[Update] After raising these issues a couple more times, the clinic eventually apologised and provided a refund for the session conducted by the MSK therapist. They also sent a get-well hamper. I appreciate these gestures, though I felt that the situation could've been handled with greater accountability earlier. The impact left a significant impact on my mum, and I hope the clinic will improve their communication and consent processes moving forward.",en,a month ago,2025-07-06T06:24:11.077107300Z,Judy Lim

This place has been a longtime favorite of mine and it continues to be. The food is consistently delicious, with a well-curated menu that always hits the spot. Whether you’re coming for a full meal or just some small plates with drinks, the menu never disappoints.

One of the highlights is the live music from Thursday to Saturday. The bands and artists are always fantastic, creating a vibrant yet relaxed atmosphere that adds so much to the overall experience.

What I really love is the flexibility of the space. You can choose between the cozy, air-conditioned indoor seating or the charming alfresco outdoor area, perfect for dining under the stars. The outdoor setup is especially magical on a clear night, with soft lighting and a warm, welcoming vibe.

The service is always friendly and the overall ambiance makes it an ideal spot for everything from casual nights out to date nights or gatherings with friends.

Highly recommended if you're looking for great food, good music, and the option to enjoy your evening your way, indoors or under the open sky.",en,a month ago,2025-07-17T02:33:09.864450325Z,Merissa Pereira

The restaurant features both spacious indoor and outdoor areas, giving it a relaxed, open-air vibe that’s perfect for Singapore’s tropical evenings. Friendly service and a warm, welcoming atmosphere make it easy to settle in for a long meal or casual drinks.

Dropped by for dinner and enjoyed the Chilli Scallop Spaghetti — well-executed with just the right amount of kick.

A great option for focus and grinding.

Credits price (at time of writing):
$10 = 115 credits
$20 = 260 credits
$50 = 750 credits

Min top up $2 (20 credits)
Card price $1

Maimai price: 8 credits per game
With the $50 promotion, each game is $0.53.
At base price each game is $0.8, a rate that beats even the bulk price of Cow Play Cow Moo Suntec.

Review:
First off, the arcade is relatively quiet and spacious. It appears to have a focus on actual games- maimai and Wangan- rather than the chance games that most arcades have too many of. Because of this, there is a distinct lack of bright lights and irritating background sounds to distract from play. The rhythm game area is lit but not too brightly, while the Wangan area is darker which (in my opinion) is great for focus.

The staff here are really chill, and very helpful. They are generally polite and easy to make payment or request service with.

Even saying all this, I have not mentioned the two main advantages of this arcade: That maimai plays are incredibly cheap (at $0.67 per game), and that the equipment is in incredible condition.

The maimai machines here are very, very new. The buttons feel completely mint (despite I believe  two of the cabs being the previous gen) and I have yet to have any reason to question the hitreg... unlike with some arcades.

Also, this arcade has 4 maimai cabs (with 2 machines each). 2 cabs are the latest gen, while 2 are the previous gen. Because the sets of 2 cabs are far from each other, people only queue for 2 cabs on one side of the arcade, with groups often sticking to one side. This may alleviate queues for smaller groups.

It is a similar story with the Wangan machines. When I last played a few months back the shifters were very clean and tight, and the wheels felt new. This will probably not change soon as despite the number of machines, there are not a lot of Wangan players here. Another advantage for maimai players, arguably.

Lastly, the arcade is in a good location. It is the first shop you see coming down the escalator to the basement, and it is near to a toilet, Sheng Shiong, and Qiji nasi lemak.

As for downsides, the most obvious is the inconvenient location. Kinex is in a rather obscure place, and is a bit irritating to reach by public transport. The mall itself is (in my opinion) uninteresting, though at least the Daiso sells work gloves (but no winter glove) that can be used for maimai.

In addition, the arcade is of course not flawless. During my last session there was an issue with the Funtan card readers, which made all but one card (mine) unable to insert credits. However, since this issue was tackled immediately by the staff, and  also led to a rather fun incident where every single player in the arcade rotated to play a single song on one cabinet, I can forgive it. As for the card system, it is both convenient but also a bit cumbersome (credits take a couple seconds to register and the buttons are hard to understand), but I prefer it overall as it saves the hassle of a huge bag of tokens.

All in all, I don't regret buy 750 credits for 75 plays and I will be coming back. If I can just....find a more convenient bus and the time to travel down.

Oh, and the mall's bicycle rack sucks so. Have fun with that. Hope you like locking only one wheel. I just use the railings.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-21T05:25:23.533264600Z,Maplestruck

The fish head meat is fresh with no sea smell. But there's still fish scales not removed totally. So, need to eat carefully.

The steamed rice is on the dry side, even go with fish gravy (not sufficient) to make the rice soft.

The steamed egg portion is small in cup size like chawamushi (Japanese style), just pure smooth steamed egg only.

stalls available in order of my favourite,

- beehoon stall. (Jul25) confirmed the bee hoon style has changed. not as nice anymore. now got a burnt taste. tried 3 weeks 3 times already to confirm. but still can order their hokkien mee and bitter gourd is nice. but pricier side.

- handmade noodle/congee. Can try their tomyum noodles. Ask to exclude chilli Padi if you cannot take it. their porridge is my go-to when I need something light. not as great as the Hougang one but is ok.

- Fishball, prawn noodle, laksa, lor mee. this stall has everything noodle, and all test legit. standard I think has dropped a bit, so I frequent less.

- Zi Char. new stall only ate once Horfun no impression.

- indian/Prata. hardly eat now since Fernvale cc hawker one came out. I remember liking it more than the Jalan kayu one.

Probably will mark this as my local now. Good place to come for a drink and relax. I usually come alone to just unwind and relax.

Yes. I also read the other comments with 1 star reviews about the quality of beer and the singing.

My experience:
1. I got the beer from the tap so it does not taste off. $28 per jug which is very reasonable.
2. Yes. The singing quality by customers is not the best but my view is that if your singing is so good, you will be a professional singer already. The crowd claps - even if you sang badly - I guess because they are applauding your courage for daring to sing in public.
3. Crowd has younger as well as older folks. Expect people to sing along even if it is not their song. It's obvious that everyone is out here to have a good time and just let their hair down.
4. Customers are friendly and you can end up making friends with some old timers here.

One possible bad point is they do not have enough snacks (i.e. nuts) on most of the occasions I am here. But they are quite chill about you buying snacks from outside to munch.

Tip: You can buy snacks from the nearby 7-Eleven next to the Punggol Nasi Lemak coffee shop. I always get the Meadows potato chips which cost just $1 per pack.

Overall, a chill and relax. If that is what you want then this is the place for you.",en,2 years ago,2023-06-24T15:08:11.084541Z,Wen How Leong

We requested to be seated at a table that was empty but the bald guy said that it was reserved. Throughout our dining no one came in to that table and it remained unoccupied the whole time.

The food and the service were below average to say the least. There is nothing special about the food.

It’s quite unhygienic as well. The waiters are always rushing. The waiters are very young, probably working illegally as students or something, and do not know how to take an order and serve an order.

Please avoid this restaurant at all cost. You can find many other good North Indian restaurants at way reasonable prices.

(5/5 Stars)

Rating Breakdown:

• Product Selection: 4/5 (Good selection of top-load washers, but limited options overall)

• Sales Assistance: 5/5 (Exceptional service from Benedict)

• Value: 4/5 (Excellent deal considering the vouchers and additional e-voucher)

• Overall Experience: 5/5 (Smooth and efficient shopping trip)

Overall: 5/5 Stars

Donkey's old washing machine finally gave up the ghost, so we set off to find a replacement.  We had government climate vouchers totaling $400 to use, and Donkey wanted a top-load, 4-tick energy-efficient model to maximize the value. Finding a suitable top-loader proved trickier than expected – they seem to be less common these days!

We went to Best Denki at Waterway Point, where they had a selection of Panasonic and Samsung top-load washers that fit the bill. After checking out the various sizes (Samsung offered 13kg, 15kg, and 16kg models, while Panasonic had only a 16kg option), Donkey chose the 13kg Samsung model – a nice upgrade from the old 9kg machine.

The sales associate, Benedict, was absolutely fantastic. He was incredibly helpful and patient, clearly explaining all the features and answering every question. His expertise made the decision process easy. Even better, Samsung included a $100 e-voucher for other stores! After all the discounts, the final price was $799, which was a great deal. Benedict also went the extra mile by demonstrating the machine’s operation, anticipating potential problems with delivery and installation. This foresight was much appreciated. The smart functions are a bonus too!

From start to finish, the whole experience at Best Denki was smooth and stress-free. I highly recommend them for their excellent customer service and good selection of appliances.  Donkey's thrilled with their new washing machine!",en,3 months ago,2025-05-18T13:40:44.632969Z,oXRYSTALo Ong

He was patient, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to explain all the features. My only gripe is the long wait at the billing counter.

Caution! 100% honest review, may be sugar-coated with sweet words that can even cause diabetes 🤣

Some of you probably would've seen me in the arcade and yes, I started going only from the first week of November 2024 and these are what I've won within a span of 2 months! I didn't even remember winning this much, until today, when I started compiling photos into my album. Yay!  💃💃💃

Tips on how to enjoy yourself at Clawgey (or how I do it, at least) :

1) Be prepared to spend your money🤣
2) Choose your game wisely. If skill-based game is not your forte, then go for the luck-based ones. However, if lady luck is still not on your side, then stand around and watch how the pro players do it - you may even get a tip or two from them!
3) Go with realistic hopes. If you don't win any that day, give yourself a pat on the back and tell yourself that you'll have better luck next time. 😊 In every game, we have to expect wins and losses; winning is indeed a happy bonus!
4) Set your personal spending limit. If you know that you have reached your limit without winning anything that day, then it's obvious that luck is not quite on your side. Have a break, and return another time - there will always be another sparkly day for you!❤️At least, you won't be too upset and not frown over not achieving what you want, despite having spent a bomb.

What's an arcade without happiness? I've had my fair share of losses as well, just like anyone else. Yes, I could've simply purchased the goods elsewhere, but I strongly refuse to because it's the joy of winning that gives me the ultimate satisfaction - sometimes I get so lucky that the winnings didn't even make sense! 🤣🤣I really enjoy being in this lovely place for the amazing vibes, the fun atmosphere and just how helpful and supportive everyone is (customers included)! The owners, Bryan and Gan, are also kind and helpful, always ready to assist you or fill you with information on how to play the games.

This place is akin to a theme park, if you ask me, minus the rides -  it gives you the adrenaline rush, sometimes to the point of you getting your heartbeat to a halt even, no joke. Your age doesn't matter too in this place, because being here makes you feel young all over again! 😍😍

Clawgey, thank you! Thumbs (and toes) up for ya. 🤣❤️

With Love,

The shortest, the smallest, sometimes extremely lucky, sometimes not 🤣🤣",en,7 months ago,2025-01-05T18:16:09.655440Z,Anonymous Me

No MRT station near the hotel, has to take a bus 30 minutes to city centre. Inconvenient for families.

Located in the red light district, right across the street there are a lot of brothels, but everything is extremely discreet, who doesn't know wouldn't realize, the girls only stay inside, not on the street. Somehow strange, very quiet. There are no bars nearby and no shops that sell alcohol (a big minus, for me).
Far from the metro, only bus stops relatively close.
Room, small, questionable cleanliness (long hair on the floor, given that I have as much hair as a frog).
In the room you have a small TV (only 5 channels, useless; I wasn't interested anyway), kettle, small fridge, safe (not working, dead display).
You don't have a socket next to the bed. There is no wardrobe for clothes, only a bar with hangers, but poorly mounted, too low, in such a way that the shirts can't hang properly, but rest on the safe located below.
The room has a window, blocked, but the view is blocked by a wall. You feel like the old defenders of medieval fortresses, looking through the embrasures.
In the bathroom you only have a shower and a toilet. The sink is in the room, but there is no soap here. You have to go into the shower, get it from the dispenser.
The luggage rack, dirty.
The AC works well, as does the Wi-Fi.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-12T09:24:10.852778Z,Paul Ciprian

We also had the buffalo wings  (read: winglets, cos it was not the whole wing) Nicely done with a generous amount of sauce 👍

Bit of context, having done a little research, Prox doesn't have a dine-in license so it should really be considered a take-away. But, not that you'd know that if you stumbled upon it.

Nicely renovated, in a cool almost scandi style. The inside space is reasonable but for some reason the layout feels cramped.

On a Sunday morning at 9am it was crowded, (squeeze in the door crowded), - good for them, nice to see a local business doing well,  two staff working their hardest but felt they were losing the battle as the orders piled up..

The coffee menu is convuleted and personally too hipster (Hot dirty Earl Spreeze, Iced Pineapple Espresso?). Lost the will to try any food as the queue was long and not moving.

One size for the coffee - had to wrangle out of the staff a skinny flat white, which could charitably be called small. So small that I double ordered rather than queue up again. At S$5.5 a pop this felt sort of reasonable but I'm guessing was only 250ml, so at S$11 for a coffee-satisfaction experience seems quite pricey in the heartlands.

The coffee itself took about 10 to 15 minutes -not the end of the world but..... Lukewarm when it arrived.

As we had our dogs with us, we tried to figure out where to place ourselves outside. Your choices are strictly limited. A bench around the corner or a couple of IKEA camping chairs.

Would I go back? Maybe, truth is they have a somewhat captive audience (search google maps to find local alternatives). The offering/pricing feels better suited to Holland V or Joo Chiat. Something a little more accessible would be nice, sorting out the 'dine-in' would be better and providing some grown up seating.  Credit for the ambition to launch this in the Seletar Hills area. Either way hope they thrive.",en,a month ago,2025-07-18T12:16:12.101911651Z,JT

We love Bryan and Javier's customer service. They helped look after a few children while they played and gave parents time to prepare food. I was impressed when Javier asked me if I needed help taking photos of them in action. I appreciate this service.

The room condition is good. There are microwaves to heat the food and a fridge to store the cake. The location next to the food court helped us get food easily. The children can continue playing at the open-water playground area to end their day.

We hope the company can filter out the noise from gamers outside while we party inside. Maybe the company can move that stepping-up game machine right outside the Room to another location. This would be the perfect place for party.

I am updating my review. Although my experience wasn’t the best, I advise you to be the judge as I am sure not everyone has a bad experience. The Nespresso machine with aeroccino bundle originally ordered from Lazada was no longer available and they suggested for me to take a ‘better’ machine without a top-up but they left out the fact that they will not be including an aeroccino. It was only mentioned by one of the employees that they are not able to offer it for the price after I received the products and questioned why it was missing. When I received the item, the box was in damaged condition with tapes in certain parts. Customer service was great only when they were trying to sell the item but after the sale, the service was slow and avoidant even when they knew I needed a quick solution as this was meant to be a gift. I had no choice but to seek a refund from Lazada. I advise you to be cautious when purchasing online and double check. You may not necessarily face the same issues but it good to be cautious.
Previous review:
Great service by FELP. I ordered products on Lazada and they were quick to let me know that the item was unavailable. They gave fast and speedy replies.

This is not an appeal but a public warning for awareness.

At the drink stall inside Food Republic, hot beverages like coffee, tea, and Milo are pre-prepared using plastic pots before being poured over ice for customers ordering iced drinks.

Just sit near the stall and observe — you’ll see how the drinks are made. The China lady handling the stall routinely uses plastic pots to store hot drinks. It’s unclear if these plastics are BPA-free or meant for high heat, but plastic in contact with hot liquids can release harmful chemicals linked to cancer and other health risks.

What’s more concerning is that when you ask for less ice, she insists on charging an extra 60 cents, even though the cup is already almost fully filled with ice by default.

The traditional method of preparing hot drinks fresh using metal pots or kettles and cooling them properly is much healthier and safer.

I urge NEA or Food Republic management to look into this matter seriously for the safety and health of consumers. Public health should never be compromised for convenience or cost-cutting.",en,a month ago,2025-07-05T03:14:38.615803348Z,Christine

Her replied are detailed to the extend she will include the accessories to the connectors and pins as well. This is as good as a turn-key experience.

I brought my daughter in as she was sick. We registered at the counter and waited along with a few other patients—three or four before us, and at least two after. Not a single person was called in for consultation. After wasting 45 minutes, the clinic assistant suddenly announced that the doctor was unwell and not coming in, and told everyone to leave.

This is completely irresponsible and disrespectful. If the doctor was unavailable, why were patients even allowed to register? Why was no one informed earlier? This shows a total lack of basic professionalism, communication, and concern for your patients’ time and well-being. Operating hours are listed as 2pm to 10pm, yet there was clearly no intention to provide care that day.

Wasting patients' time like this—especially when dealing with sick patient—is disgraceful. Patients are not just numbers; they are paying clients who deserve transparency and respect. Shameful conduct.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-04T11:11:01.897501Z,hong eric

To my surprise, the doctor brushed off my concerns/requests and told me that I would recover on my own with the help of some anti-inflammatory/painkilling medication. He flatly refused to provide any referrals.

After getting a 2nd opinion at another clinic, I went for a MRI scan which revealed I had 2 fully-torn and 1 partially-torn ankle ligaments. And a week later, I went for tightrope fixation surgery which, as the surgeon told me, should have been done asap.

Staff was helpful and proactive. They saw my unsuccessful attempts trying to print the boarding pass, asked about what I had and what I was missing and made suggestions.

However, these self service check-in kiosks are actually identical to the ones at the terminals. Those at the terminals also entertain early check-ins.

So I don't think it's actually that useful to come and check in here, particularly because if you're taking the subway to the airport, you'll have to lunge your luggages for a very long way to get to this lounge.

I went from Tampines' direction via bus. Don't be fooled by Google Maps where it was suggested to cut through Republic Poly to reach the place. You'll need to circle Republic Poly and follow the main roas to access the Forest Adventure. There are nearer bus stops to the place, I suppose. But it can be really frustrating if you got get down at the wrong ""recommended"" stop, because you'll end up fast-paced walking under the hot sun for 20-25 mins just to reach the place. The nearest MRT station Bedok Reservoir seems to be 15 mins walk away. Perhaps that's a better option.

There was this promotion online that only works on your birthday month. I didn't read the T&C properly, and applied this promotional code when I bought the tickets. We'll need to top up to the full price at the location for our tickets since it's non-refundable. It was my fault for not reading the T&C clearer. But I don't think it's very difficult to apply an interlock when purchasing the ticket? Just block the promotional code to be used if the birthday month input is not in the same month during the purchase. Because then I'll save SGD 50.90 ... 😂 Don't think it's worth the price (and the time taken to reach the place) ... Should have topped up SGD 30 more and go to USS instead for the thrill 😂

The harness is a half-body harness. So, unless you somehow overturn yourself, you should be quite safe from slipping out of the harness. Which, in other words, also tells you that this is (supposedly) a relatively safe course (kids can go for the Grand course too if you meet the minimum height). It's a good exposure for adults though, if this is your first time.

So ... The verdict?
Fun? Not bad. Except my mood started off bad (again, okay, I also understand it's my own fault for not checking the T&C properly).
Will I come again? ..... Nahh. Would spend the money elsewhere.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-03T13:03:16.575345Z,Angie Lee

My car’s suspension system had become dangerously unstable, and I urgently needed a replacement. I found Edwin Garage through Carousell and Google, and I’m so glad I did.

Despite having a packed schedule, Edwin still managed to slot me in for an appointment. He attended to me right away upon my arrival, and his responses via WhatsApp were prompt and helpful.

His diagnostic skills are among the best I’ve encountered. He took the time to clearly explain the issues and recommended only the essential parts that needed replacement.

He understands that car repairs can be costly and never-ending, so he suggests gradual fixes for those who can’t afford everything at once; a truly considerate approach.

I was also surprised (in a good way!) to see a large, capable team at his workshop; at least six mechanics, which is more than I’ve seen at any other workshop. Rest assured, Edwin personally test-drives your car for diagnosis before handing it over to his team for repairs.

Pricing was competitive and completely transparent. Edwin even wrote out a list of the required parts along with their prices and advised me to replace them gradually, depending on my financial situation.

I’m genuinely grateful for Edwin’s help. Honest, transparent, and ethical mechanics like him are rare these days. Please keep up the good work and service! 👍🏻",en,2 months ago,2025-06-12T21:06:42.129906Z,Kim Jun Hong

Despite the holiday crowd, the wait time for food was surprisingly short. All the dishes we ordered were served almost simultaneously, which was a pleasant surprise. We appreciated that everyone at our table could start eating together such thoughtful coordination really enhanced our dining experience.

We ordered the Hearty Breakfast, Salmon Eggs Benedict Croissant, Smashed Avocado Toast, and Garlic Cheese Toast. My personal favourite was the Salmon Eggs Benedict Croissant—it was rich, flavorful, and beautifully prepared. The Garlic Cheese Toast, while tasty, could have used a stronger garlic punch to better live up to its name.

As expected on a public holiday, the restaurant was bustling and quite noisy, but the lively atmosphere added to the charm rather than detracting from it.

Overall, the food was enjoyable with well-balanced flavours and attractive presentations. Each dish seemed to be prepared with care, both in terms of taste and visual appeal. It was a delightful experience, and we’d definitely consider coming back.",en,a month ago,2025-07-19T10:09:39.729443768Z,Shirley Mok

What bloody logic is that to come from a medical professional?!
And also, I wasn’t even given the Medical Certificate as per promised by the two young ladies at the counter.
Not only that, the overall diagnosis was like nonchalant and simply brushed me off to A&E perhaps due to the reason that he feels he wasn’t capable of rendering medical advice to me!!!

Seriously made me wonder how the hell did he graduate from medical college?!

In terms of the service I received from the seller, I couldn't have been happier. Shawn was meticulous, responsive and helpful from start to finish, answering all of my questions and providing me with all of the information and updates I needed.

I encountered excellent service from a Chinese young staff who was incredibly patient and helpful as i check the oranges. He even allowed us to swap a rotten orange on the spot, which was greatly appreciated.

But upon proceeding to the cashier counter, this manager of the supermarket, approached the Chinese staff and began to scold him for allowing us to swap the rotten orange.

The manager stated that the staff should have open another new box of oranges to see again instead of one to one swap, claiming that they will make losses if we keep swapping.

We believe that:
* Opening each box individually would have been extremely time-consuming and inconvenient for customers. The new box would still have chances to find rotten oranges.
* The manager's loud reprimand of the staff member in front of us was unprofessional and disrespectful to both the staff and the customer.

The quality of the bathroom was particularly impressive, as it was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, contributing to a high level of comfort.

The hotel’s facilities were comprehensive, catering to all the essential needs of guests. Everything from amenities to the overall infrastructure was thoughtfully provided, ensuring a convenient stay.

What stood out most during my stay, however, was the exemplary service provided by the staff. Every member of the team was exceptionally friendly and helpful, creating a welcoming atmosphere throughout the hotel. A special mention goes to Glenda, a staff member who was particularly remarkable. She went above and beyond in assisting me with resolving an issue, offering practical and timely solutions that made my stay even more enjoyable.

I don’t usually shop much, so I was a bit lost at first. Thankfully, I was blessed to be served by Julie, who made the whole process so smooth and enjoyable.

Julie was incredibly patient, attentive, and had a great sense of humor that put me at ease right away. She really went the extra mile to help us find the perfect gift. Without her, we probably wouldn’t have been able to decide on such a meaningful present.

If you’re planning to shop there, I highly recommend asking for Julie—she’ll make sure you leave happy!

Plus, they’re currently having a 50% sale, so it’s the perfect time to visit.

The staff inside the stall cutting up the meat then said in a mocking sing-song tone “$5.30?!”, and the staff collecting the money concurred, adding that if that was the price, there would be a long queue.

This attitude is very rude and disrespectful. I am never going to pastronise your stall ever again.",en,2 years ago,2023-05-26T04:01:54.312194Z,Ong Xiao Hui

Stepped into this one, was pretty impressed at first by the amount of vintage items and a lot of jewellery with gem stones too.

However, we walked out shortly as the attitude of the staff was ridiculously arrogant — refusal to let us know the prices, and there two people at the counter, with no one else at the shop, no one was bothered to come and let us know the prices and just stood there.

I’ve owned retail stores and have personally worked in retail and this level of service is embarrassing beyond belief. It almost feels like this shop is simply unbothered to make any sales.

Why open the shop at all?

Why step into the shop at all?

Reading the reviews below, it seems like our experience is pretty common.

They tested n inspected all the component under the brake system and spotted my rear brake drum pump interior is leaking and also identified that my brake booster was having a defect...

As a Google reviewer, im a pleased with their servicing n willingness to go extra mile taking part by part out to examine the problem proven a safety to driver n passenger.

Even for pricing they are open to ensure it is effortable for customer in trouble.

I trust them and they given you the trust to ensure everything of your concern is taken care off.

I had a great experience at Accord Auto Services Pte Ltd at AMK Autopoint. After getting a quote from another workshop in Kaki Bukit that recommended several parts to be changed, I decided to get a second opinion here—and I’m glad I did!

The team at Accord Auto Services was professional and thorough in their assessment. They took the time to inspect my vehicle carefully and reassured me about what truly needed to be replaced and what could still last. Unlike some workshops that push for unnecessary changes, they provided honest advice and clear explanations, which gave me full confidence in their recommendations.

The service was efficient, and the pricing was fair. It’s refreshing to find a workshop that values integrity and customer trust over just making a quick sale. I’ll definitely be coming back for future servicing and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and honest workshop!",en,4 months ago,2025-04-02T07:22:41.802731Z,Khairi Muhd

Mr. Yap who handle my 5 years old car for 10k servicing routine. Same Servicing Package: Liqui Moly Molygen New Generation 5W40 Fully Synthetic (including Engine Oil & Oil Filter) + Comprehensive 21 Point checks

Same package same price, this time round not require any part replacement. Glad that my car was at good conditions after their first servicing work. Everything as good as before. Hope this time round, car perform as good as their last servicing result. Crossed fingers ya 🤞🏻

Thank you Mr. Yap for their quick turnaround work, they completed around 2 hours, due to less crowded weekday so I'm able to collect my car much early.

I'm really satisfied their overall good service from online appointment booking to on-site servicing works, and of course, great results and reasonable price. Definitely recommend this great workshop to all.",en,9 months ago,2024-11-07T07:39:12.789643Z,Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets)

After doing claim repair for the front of my car with them, I collected the car and told Ms Lee that I will be returning to collect my old headlamps, which while having few chips, are still usable and I promised a friend I would sell them to him. She said ok and I told her to safekeep for me when I return another day to collect.

The next week I came back to collect it, the repair crew told me they threw it away already. I explained my situation and the agreement and they told me ""now how?"" and referred me to the office staff (probably the owner). I explained my situation and sought her understanding that I am losing a deal of $2000 used original headlamps to a friend, she merely offered $100 as ""token"". I understand that she is running a business and thus I lowered my compensation value to $500 and she did not budge. Still keeping at $100 and offered discounts for spray service instead to make up the difference of $400. While she was nice and wasnt rude, I feel that this is disrespectful in dealing with my losses which I had agreed upon with Ms Lee.

I felt like the offer was a straight up slap to the face so I decided to leave without the deal that she offered.

To make matters worse, when I arrived home the same day, I saw that the headlamps wasnt sealed properly and there was heavy condensation within the headlamps.

I am beyond pissed with this workshop.",en,a year ago,2023-09-18T10:14:34.795934Z,Syazwan Rasidi

Their coffee game has improved. This time we had the pour overs. They have a decent selection with some beans having unique flavor notes. I liked it. The barista who prepared my coffee looked very professional and skilled.

You have the option to seat inside or outside. Because of the summer heat, I stayed inside.

They encourage to order via the QR code that leads you to their website where you can order and pay.

Smooth and informative service. Not too crowded too.

I've went to the cheapest car workshops to service my car before but it cannot be compared to Riverview Auto. I also think it's better to do a good one for my six year old car rather than going to a cheaper but lousy alternative.

It was worth the money. Not only were they friendly and helpful when I was in doubt, the boss recommended what work was needed to be done for my car. There were many parts that needed to be changed that the previous workshops didn't tell me to.

After servicing, my car ride was smoother. My car didn't vibrate so much anymore and my steering wheel was so smooth like butter. It was as if my car is brand new.

Highly recommend their car servicing!",en,3 years ago,2022-05-27T13:15:18.763934Z,Chuan Ian. O

Both he and Carole also gave us fantastic food recommendations, and every place they suggested was a hit!

Our room was definitely a tight fit for three people, but it was spotless thanks to Toh, who kept it clean and comfortable throughout our stay.

One thing to note: the hotel is a bit far from the main tourist areas, about 40-50 minutes by bus or train. After a night out in Clarke Quay, taking a Grab back wasn’t exactly cheap. The closest MRT station is about a 13-minute walk away, which can feel a bit long after a full day out. That said, the surrounding area has plenty of food and shopping options, so there’s still a lot to explore nearby.

Overall, a great experience with super friendly staff and clean accommodations, just be prepared for a bit of a commute if you’re heading to the central tourist spots.",en,a month ago,2025-07-22T12:56:32.685864455Z,Denise L

Gadget Mix, tucked away along the Punggol Waterway, is a hidden gem for tech enthusiasts like Donkey and me. We've been there a few times now, and the friendly, helpful staff always make us feel welcome.

Donkey was having serious trouble with his phone screen protector – it was full of bubbles and driving him crazy! The guy at Gadget Mix was fantastic, quickly replacing it with a sleek matte screen protector for a very reasonable price. Donkey's phone looks great now, and he's super happy with the new screen protector.

Later, while we were enjoying a delicious dinner at Fish & Co., Donkey's phone battery started to die. Feeling like a tech disaster, I knew I needed to act fast. I remembered that Gadget Mix had helped him out before, so I ran back to see if they could help again. And guess what? They were amazing! They even lent us a portable charger so Donkey could charge up his phone. Talk about going above and beyond!

We went back to Gadget Mix after dinner hoping to find a portable charger of our own, but their 20,000mAh options were a bit heavy for us. Still, they had a great selection and the staff were patient as they explained the different choices.

The combination of friendly staff, great service, and a welcoming atmosphere make Gadget Mix a highly recommended tech shop. We'll definitely be back!",en,8 months ago,2024-12-11T06:51:51.810162Z,oXRYSTALo Ong

At the beginning, the experience from start to finish was pleasant. Timely update of every step of the car servicing is a big plus as we are informed while we carry on with our busy schedule.

However, my horrible experience started then. Before AutoApp, I had a review with my first mechanic. I was told as my car has 5 years left before scrap, it is not worth major part replacements. Just make sure all oil is at maintained at the optimal level.

# 1st service #
With AutoApp, I was told to replace front lower arms (not sure if it is really necessary), driveshaft oil seals, spark plugs (not sure if it is really necessary), AT fluid, brake flush, coolant flush. Cost me almost 1.8K in total. Considering safety, I trust the workmanship and went ahead.

# 2nd service #
After the car came back, I noticed the car could not move off at cold start. It took some time before crawling off and drive normally. A job not done properly, I went back to AutoApp.

I was explained that the transmission fluid leaks from the torque converter oil seal, due to pressure after the driveshaft oil seal being replaced causing leaks from worn out/weak seals to leak. That requires the gearbox to be disassemble, in order to reach the seals. That is an extra cost of 800+.

I questioned that at the first place, was the replacement of driveshaft oil seal really necessary? And now I had to pay extra for complications due to the workshop poor decision at 1st place..

# 6 April #
The car came back a few weeks back. Drive was fine just for 1 week +. Additionally, I noticed an unusual leak below the car, suspecting is from the gearbox.

Today, the car could not even engage into any gear. After going to my family mechanic to check, it turned out to be the gear cable is loose, missing a stopper to prevent the cable from falling out. End up having to tighten the cable.

# 10 April #
The problem with slow drive off during cold start is back again!!!

This is just my personal experience, so proceed with caution.",en,a year ago,2024-04-10T04:30:09.032953Z,Gin D Pang

Here are the positive aspects:

1. The customer support team was exceptionally responsive and provided excellent assistance throughout the entire process. This level of customer service is commendable and stands out in the automotive industry in Singapore.

2. The AutoSG app is user-friendly and offers convenient features. It allows users to monitor their status and progress, and even facilitates hassle-free payments within the app.

3. They are punctual, which I appreciate. When they state they will arrive at 9:30 a.m., they do so without fail. Their professionalism is commendable.

Below are the feedback points:

1. The driver left the air conditioning on full blast and the lights on after turning off the ignition. I take good care of my car and prefer not to have the air conditioning on full blast. The driver should have turned it off before turning off the car!!

2. This is by far my biggest disappointment :  the quoted price for the repair of my side mirror. I recently brought my car to them for a motor-like sound that occurs when I close and reopen the mirror. A previous car technician had informed me that the issue was with a plastic rotor that needed to be replaced. However, AutoApp has quoted me a significant amount of $620 to replace the entire mirror, stating that it is unrepairable. It seems excessive for a replacement part. Sorry but this is just absurd.

I regret to inform you that you have lost a customer due to a misunderstanding regarding the repair of my side mirror.

I have since sought a second opinion from another workshop, where I was quoted a more reasonable price of $100 for the repair, including the replacement part.

This will be the first and last time I allow someone to drive my car.

Thanks but no thanks AutoApp 🙂 👍",en,a year ago,2024-04-16T09:03:12.052788Z,Marvin Harris

True, staff can sometimes be curt. But one understands the patient load they deal with. Usually packed! They appreciate I say hello, goodbye etc and reciprocate, and often say take care as I leave. Recall the horrified look from supposedly the fierce auntie when I took tablets without water! Was concerned I would choke and asked did I need water. I'm fine, I can dry swallow meds.

Have seen all the doctors several times. All good, some more friendly, some more formal, fair enough. One was very quick to respond when I later emailed to clarify something. Another noted in my health screening my cholesterol was borderline. Advised no need to take meds, let's try monitoring and lifestyle and diet changes first, as all meds have side effects. Kudos. You gave sensible advice when issuing meds would have been safer if anything went wrong, plus you have foregone earning a few bucks.

Another time had bad pain in the bowels. First time treated me, said could be kidney stones, gave me an injection for the pain, warned if persists, go A&E. Cleared up. Second time it happened, got scolded! Why are you here? Go A&E right now! Do you need an ambulance? That's good service again, foregoing making money for the patient's well being.

True, wait times can be long. Speak to the nurse if you need to cut queue because you're in pain. Afternoons probably also less crowded. Usually two doctors on duty, so it isn't that bad. True, they are closed roughly 1045 to 1230 every day for lunch, again fair enough. Can't say what time they close in the evenings, though imagine dinner time the same gap is there.

I will still come back here even though it's now a bit far. The service is good, they've never overcharged me. Plus I'd like to see that horrified look on the nurse once again ... :)",en,5 months ago,2025-03-14T07:21:46.116473Z,Ronald Hee

Then one day during a body massage, Lily noticed my toe and gave it special attention. To my surprise and absolute relief, I actually felt a difference immediately! I could slowly flex my toe again — something I hadn’t been able to do in ages. She explained to me why and taught me what to do when I’m at home to improve even more. Thank you so much!

Portion size is really good at this price point. FYI, the Pho Bo and Pho Ga were both oos by 2pm on a weekday but give the other items on the menu a try!

Spacious, well-ventilated coffee shop with plenty of clean tables and no birds flying around. Always a huge plus in my books.

Tried the new Vietnamese stall that just opened. The queue moved quickly – waited about five minutes with around seven people ahead.

Ordered the beef pho ($6.50). The broth was flavourful and hearty, with a slight hint of MSG but overall still enjoyable. Good portion of noodles, fresh bean sprouts, vegetables, and a decent amount of meat.

What stood out was how tender the beef slices and beef tendon were. They poured the hot soup directly over the raw beef slices, letting the residual heat cook them just right. In fact, they appeared slightly pink in my pictures but it wasn’t obvious to me in person. The slices were thicker than usual, and surprisingly tender.

Overall, a satisfying and affordable bowl of pho. Would recommend!",en,a month ago,2025-07-21T06:21:41.327032966Z,D Lo

I notice that she treats all her customers with respect. She welcomes everyone with a beautiful and sincere smile. She is very soft spoken and kind. She reminds all seniors about the senior discounts. The strange thing is that I shop at Cold Storage only on Wednesday because of the Senior discount. Yet, when I go to the self check counters, I sometimes forget and when Ms Alice is on duty, she will remind me.  Once I went there and after paying, I realised that I had forgotten to activate the senior discount. I saw Alice and I told her. From that day onwards, she never fails to remind me about the Senior discount. How thoughtful of her! She is very warm and makes me very welcome whenever she sees my friend and I.
I would also like to commend Ms Esther Chua. Sometime back, we were at Cold Storage, NEX. We noticed that the smoked duck was on special and we love the smoked duck in Cold Storage. We were served by Ms Esther Chua. She is so jolly and cheerful. She took a duck and we saw a bigger one below that one. So like the typical kiasu Singaporean, we asked her if we could have the bigger one instead. We noted that she had already put the smoked duck in the takeaway bag. However, she was extremely nice and with a big, beautiful smile, she put the duck we chose into another bag and gave it to us. This is important to us as we have encountered service staff who would give us a dirty look before acceding to our requests. Ms Esther Chua was however all smiles.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-18T05:51:47.044515295Z,Rachel

It have being my regular clinic (450A, Tampines). There were reviews that the clinic assistant were rude and fee were expensive.
When come to services, it is very subjective. Different people have different expectation. I am very simple, I am not expecting the clinic assistant to welcome me like some hotel lobby staff. After all, I am sick and I just want to see and go. I am also not expecting them to chit with me which they are suppose to minimise conversation. Generally, they are like clinic assistant of other clinics or government hospital I been to. I have seen worst elsewhere.
For fee, I tot it was reasonable. I will leave it for you to judge; 1 cough syrup, I throat medical, 1 throat sweet, 2 painkiller and consultation with Dr Ivan for $57. Is that not reasonable? To me it is reasonable because this is a GP not polyclinic.
Generally, I don't have issue with this clinic. Do remember to wear a mask when you visit, mask is a must in this clinic.",en,2 years ago,2023-07-24T07:50:30.191841Z,Kass Kwek

There's one receptionist (patient service) chinese lady, fat and wearing blue tshirt with
louis vuitton font on her right chest area, she is so rude raise the voice towards me in unhappy way and impatient asking me to be faster giving her my 3yrs old daughter while im carry my daughter having high fever.

I told why u seem unhappy about and being very rude? She roll her eyes and give hand gesture to go away..

I told DR IVAN about it, but seem the doctor also cant be bother. While i was making the payment i ask another lady can i know who the another lady name, she say tat the lady dont want to give her name.

I told her, ur clinic is service line.. we dont need this kind of people who seem very rude towards the patient. How if there's emergency happen in the clinic do you want to behave this way? If you not happy working there just resign..

VIVA CLINIC YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO REALLY CAN DO THEIR WORK WELL.. NOT SOMEONE WHO HAVE ATTITUDE PROBLEM!!

The music system and karaoke room were fantastic additions, adding to the lively ambiance. The pool table, which could convert into air hockey, was a big hit among our friends. The huge hall space was perfect for dining and socializing, accommodating our group of over 40 guests comfortably.

The organizers were incredibly professional and timely, ensuring that everything ran smoothly and were in working condition. The cleanliness of the space was impeccable.

I recently took my car to Elite Car Ventures for a turbo leak issue, and I couldn’t be more satisfied with their service. From the moment I arrived, their team was professional, knowledgeable, and thorough in diagnosing the problem. Not only did they identify the turbo leak efficiently, but they also performed a full diagnostic test to check for any other underlying issues.

What really stood out was their transparency and willingness to explain everything in detail. They didn’t just tell me what was wrong—they showed me the problem areas and walked me through the possible solutions. They gave me multiple options to fix the issue, ensuring I understood the costs and benefits of each approach.

The repair was done with precision, and my car now runs better than ever. I appreciate their honesty, expertise, and commitment to customer satisfaction.

Second, when I first book the appointment it was directed to a mobile number as stated on Google. The doctor then told me to call the clinic at 62844498. His tone of voice used during the call wasn't friendly and sounded frustrated.

Third, I have clearly mentioned that the purpose of the call is for the CareShield life assessment when I made the appointment. I was only told that I need to bring my documents and didn't specify exactly that I needed an approval letter from AIC to do the assessment . When I turned up for the appointment it was then communicated to me on the phone when I'm downstairs, the doctor said that he did not know what he need to assess me for despite saying it is for CareShield Life. He was arrogant and sounded very frustrated.

Our funeral planner passed Dr Kong’’s number and my sister contacted him to come over to the house to verify the death of my father.

I still remembered what Dr Kong is wearing on that night when he came into the room. A pair of black framed spectacles, thick gold necklace, Cartier watch and big contemporary jade ring. Is he going for a party or to a deceased family?

There are a few things which my family and I were very annoyed:
1) The way he handled and examined the body of my deceased father - he removed roughly the tubing still inserted on the deceased.

2) As our father will not be emblemed, we ask a favour from him to remove the urinary catheter to allow us to clean his body. He replied that this is not within his scope of work ( normally done by undertakers ) and if he is going to do so, he will be charging us extra. What sort of doctor is he? How can he be even practitioner when he has such a lousy character and morale ?!

3) Time is like money to him. Rushing all the way to end. $380 under a 15 mins job.

4) No Sincerity.

Our experience with him is really very bad. Probably he only show respects and well mannered to live persons since they are humans while dead ones are just empty shells.

I hope this kind of practitioner will not be listed in the GP list for deceased family. This will create more painful frustrating moments.

Quite a treat when it’s during low tide where you can see fish, fiddler crabs and other marine life eg mud crabs, swimming or roaming in their habitats. Monkeys are a constant. Be careful of your belongings and be mindful not to bring any plastic bags or open tote bags as these fellas will not be afraid to pull them off you and rummage through. If that happens, do not resist or pull the bags but just  wait for them to stop and collect the items back. You wouldn’t want to be attacked or worse still create a commotion where the monkey calls in the calvary… you can take a pretty long walk from the jetty to reach here, cycle or get the “taxi vans” on the island to bring you there.

He patiently listened and mentioned that it could be due to several possible reasons, but advised me to bring the car in for a proper inspection first.

After a thorough check—which they even recorded on video and shared with me—it turned out that the issue wasn’t as serious as I was led to believe by another workshop. Instead of needing to replace expensive parts (as I was previously quoted, costing several thousand dollars), it was just a matter of tightening a screw. In the end, I only paid for the labour fees.

I really appreciate their honesty and transparency. They could have easily overcharged me like the other workshop, but they didn’t. It’s rare to find such integrity in this industry.

I also found out that, beyond car servicing, they offer a range of other services like car spray painting, tuning, and more—truly a one-stop solution for all car needs. No more running around to different places for different problems!

Highly Recommended!

I recently sent my car to Euroauto Garage for an inspection and was thoroughly impressed with the experience. The staff were friendly, professional, and very knowledgeable—they took the time to explain the issues clearly and offered honest advice without pushing unnecessary repairs.

It’s rare to find a workshop that’s trustworthy, skilled, and genuinely customer-focused. I’ll definitely be returning for future servicing, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for reliable car care in Singapore.",en,a month ago,2025-07-30T05:35:24.565900870Z,Mike Loh

Repair works are done well, never had any issues after. They don’t tell you to change parts if it can last until the next servicing but will pre alert you, this is what I like as you can prepare for preventive maintenance. I can see that their technical guys are knowledgeable and approachable for some chit chat about cars! Alex and his team are super responsive even after office hours.

It was in my mind, with my limited words he truly provided me with what i wanted. He was very helpful, kind and patient. I am very satisfied with his service and we need such people in this service industry to cater and help us with our purchase. Feeling very contented with my purchase. Great work Alex and Thank you so much for assisting me.

A complaint letter for its management:

Hi.

I would like to report of an unpleasant incident involving the outlet at Sengkang Grand Mall.

There were two staff, one male and one female, in the store on 28 March between 11.10 and 11.15pm. The male staff, who served me, blamed me for not informing him of the yuu points. So I asked him if it was my fault and he insisted that I should have told him earlier before he scanned my purchase.

As this male Indian staff was not in his uniform and hence there was no name tag on him, I asked him for his name but he refused to do so, even after my fourth time asking. His colleague, Joey, the other female staff who was in uniform, could not convinced him.

Also I believe that I had given the male Indian cashier $10 for my purchase but he denied and insisted that I had given him $5. He also did not provide me a receipt.

After this incident, I am inclined to think that this outlet employs fraudsters. I asked Joey if his Indian colleague is a temp staff and she replied ""no"". So under such circumstances, I believe that this particular Indian staff has serious attitude problem that needs to be addressed.

Lastly, besides having a reasonable explanation and action from 7-11 about his undeserving employee, I would also like to request for the 7-11 management to review of the CCTV footage to confirm my contract is genuine, and that I had given the Indian employee $10 and not $5.

This is not the first time I experienced bad service at this outlet. It is the first time I experienced service staff unreasonably argue with customers and refuse to give his name, obviously guilty and fear of one's action.

Please revert the outcome of this complaint in writing.

Thank you.",en,a year ago,2024-03-28T15:57:01.824641Z,Melvin Ho

Here's what you must try:

1. 5/5. TANG²: Depending on what you get, ranges from $11 (1 portion) to about $25. THIS IS MY FAV STORE.  I highly recommend getting suan cai or tomato soup (because I haven't managed to try the rest yet lol). Yumz. You know these are legit when it comes with roast peanut, cilantro, and garlic bits. Super flavourful - rice was perfectly cooked the last 3 times I had this.

2. 4/5: Western Boy. Delicious fish & chips. Fries were addictive! Only didn't like the salad that came with it. Won't top up to get the set since that salad's included. Their menu's extensive, will need to try other stuff next.

3. 3/5 Cheeky Beehoon: Partner had it and recommends going for the soup version instead. Priced a bit steep imo. Also, the crab dumplings were nothing special.. more on the peppery side and rather bland. Didn't feel satisfying imo.

4. 2/5: Chicken rice. Was quite disappointed by the mushy rice since I could have gone for TANG² instead. Rare for chicken rice shops to get this wrong. Please fix thissss. Roast chicken was fairly average. Not tender. And tofu was tough and didn't have much flavour. Won't get this anymore.

5. Hao Lai Ke. Refraining from rating as I havent tried it since the renovation. I think stir fried noodles and fried rice should be alright- seeing a lot of people having the noodles which looks pretty yummy.",en,a year ago,2024-03-09T15:03:43.247162Z,Rianne

Kopitiam is fairly clean when I visited late morning. Not pack.

Ordered chicken rice, the people are friendly. The taste quite blend. Ordered chicken breast with veg set. Comes with (tasteless) soup and rice (rather big portion). Chicken meat fair amount and thickness.

No need to queue after lunch hour. Food prepared briskly. Food looked pretty decent. Lard bits and all. Chilli paste the noodle was tossed in was most ordinary tasting. Most probably taken off their supplier. Noodle could do with more vinegar in there as well.

The Kaya Toast was a highlight, just like we’d heard. The coffee was rich and aromatic, and our kids loved the local snacks. The service was fast and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food.

Truly a sly guy
The repairman behind the counter agreed with my father with a reasonable price to fix my phone LED
After fixing my phone and waited for 5 hours. The problems i noticed immediately was the gap between the screen and the frame and there was damages at the sides. He purposefully put my case on to hide the gap and the damages, upon asking the person about the gap and just only to find him saying about it being a thicker variant of led. After that when I press moderately hard there would appear a black spot underneath like the ones when you press on the tv screen Not only that but the pixels can be easily seen. Clearly downgraded from 1080x2244 pixels to 750x1334 pixels and the delay became really noticeable from a glace, afterwards I asked him but only met with silence.
After I paid him and walking out of the mall I realised there was burn marks at the corners of the screen and a slightly white mark where I previously press on when it suddenly became the entire screen was black
I gone to the repairman to ask what happen and he gave me a bunch of non sense saying I purposefully try to spoil it and tried to gaslight saying I had an option to use 3rd party products or the original. I told him I want a refund and I would give him back the broken led screen and have back my old one I used previously (note my screen had a minor black dot with blue and purple circle after each other)
I sawed that half of my old led screen was serverly cracked and when I saw him trying to take out the led screen I saw that he had ravaged the insides.

So this doctor is the first line of defence for my whole family. We seldom need to go back twice because his diagnosis is good and medication is just right.  He don’t like to give you antibiotics unnecessarily, and if your body has chance to fight it off, he will encourage you to let body fight, no medication needed.  And true enough, we can recover without medication.  But if he give medication, meaning we really need them.  Very ethical and very caring, always concern if the medication is good for our health.  So trusted his judgement and treatment a lot.  If he said don’t know, is just honest assessment, most doctor just guess what sickness you have based on the symptoms and make guess on your sickness.  But Dr Lee don’t make guess, if he is unsure, he will say I don’t know, I think is just been truthful.  This is better then guess wrongly and give wrong diagnosis.

I found it interesting to be able to discover a TUTU kueh stall selling just that and muah chee,  which u don't see often since rent these days are high and such food are only found at night markets. There is even a char kway teow stall that serves the dish with a sunny side up egg on top. You can't miss the stall's name : 'dancing char kway teow'.

If u enjoy having your meals outside, there are options as seats can also be found outdoors for u to people-watch as well.

We grabbed a seat outside, where the breeze was cool and uncles next to us were deep in beer, tea, and stories. It felt like stepping into a childhood memory.

But the food? Pure magic.

First up, the claypot rice — every grain smoky and fragrant, with lap cheong and salted fish adding bursts of savoury sweetness. That crispy rice at the bottom? Heavenly.

Then came a surprise: the fried egg with oyster, or orh luak — not your usual. The eggs were extra crispy, the oysters plump and fresh, and that rich gravy poured on top was next-level. A slight char in the flavour made it insanely addictive.

I accidentally ordered the dry bee hoon with fish, lala, and Napa cabbage, expecting soup — but what a win. The seafood was fresh and generous, and the sauce clung to every strand of vermicelli, bursting with ocean flavour. The Batang fish was thick, juicy, and rich.

And the fried Hokkien prawn mee? Absolutely divine. That deep prawn broth flavour, the perfect wok hei, and nostalgic taste hit all the right spots. It’s been ages since I had Hokkien mee this good.

Around us, the sound of clinking beer bottles and chatter made the food even better. Circuit Road isn’t just a hawker centre — it’s a flavour-packed escape.",en,3 months ago,2025-05-31T05:15:38.134981Z,Jay Tham

It offers a peaceful, nostalgic vibe with white sandy beaches, swaying coconut trees, and a slower pace that feels far removed from the city’s bustle.

The park is especially popular for those looking for a quiet spot to enjoy nature. It’s less crowded than East Coast Park, making it ideal for tranquil walks, picnics, or simply watching the waves. You’ll often find joggers, cyclists, and families with kids playing at the two playgrounds scattered along the path.

One of the highlights is plane-spotting—Changi Beach offers up-close views of aircraft taking off and landing at nearby Changi Airport. For history lovers, there’s also a small WWII memorial near Changi Point, marking the site of historical significance.

Facilities include barbecue pits, clean restrooms, bicycle paths, and fitness corners. Parking is available at multiple lots and public transport is easily accessible. You can also enjoy fishing at designated jetties or explore low-tide marine life like hermit crabs and mudskippers.

Whether you’re there for a sunrise jog, sunset picnic, or a quiet moment of reflection, Changi Beach Park delivers a refreshing escape with a touch of old-school charm.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-08T17:19:49.219908Z,Crumpled Nomad

Changi Beach Park is one of the oldest coastal parks and is popular with locals for
its tranquillity and relaxed ambience. Approximately 3.3km long, this linear park has
stretches of pristine white beaches dotted with coconut palms and barbecue pits. The
park is in the vicinity of Changi Village, a vibrant corner of the island where good food,
bargains and various facilities await.
The kampong ambience has been carefully retained while a jogging track and other
amenities were added. Visitors can jog or cycle along the winding tracks to Changi
Ferry Terminal.
Also found within the district are places of interest, which are part of Singapore’s natural
and historical heritage. Aside from the Changi Museum and Chapel, you can find
designated heritage trees, Pulau Ubin and Chek Jawa (a bumboat ride away). Changi
Beach Park promises to offer visitors a fun-filled recreational experience.",en,2 months ago,2025-06-20T03:12:06.249109434Z,KEEKYTUX JOURNEY
