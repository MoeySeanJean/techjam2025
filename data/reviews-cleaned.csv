Terrible. This is a lie. This is not ice cream! This gum is an ice cream substitute.,1
Pukka is a restaurant by the sea where you will have the most beautiful pictures and videos where you can organize a nice organization in Marmaris.,1
The most successful steak restaurant in the region. It is also a world brand. With its carefully selected meats and cooking technique; it gives the price you what you pay.,1
Koycegiz is the most popular restaurant and cafe. You can have a meal with the view of Köyceğiz lake and sip your cold beer with pleasure.,1
I ate better waffle's in past.,1
The business demands money from everything; no treats!,1
Reviews are misleading; I definitely do not recommend. Too bad.,1
They even charge for treats!,1
Unnecessarily expensive; the Arab is addressing the tourist. good taste.,1
Seriously cheap and affordable price for those who want to eat delicious meat doner kebab.,1
I don't understand why people wait so long to eat an average pizza.,1
The prices are the same as the market; but the staff and service quality are better than others; their special tastes are definitely recommended.,0
We came because it is a very famous place. They had really delicious food.,0
They make the pizza in a wood fired stone oven. It's different than any pizza you've experienced before. They use cheddar cheese as cheese. We preferred the 2 and 3 special pizzas.,0
A successful business. It's pretty good in food. Prices could be a little more reasonable.,0
A nice cozy place. It is easily accessible from all parts of the city. It is very interesting that the restaurant does not have a menu.,0
The hamburger bread was very nice. I didn't like his meatballs very much.Orders are coming out very quickly; and the working friends are very kind; thank you.,0
Clean place; the service is good; Prices are not very cheap. generally the Arabs are leaving; locals are also present. Service is fast.,0
The tastes; the approach of the stuff to you and the quality of service are very good; of course; especially if you can find a place on the weekend.,0
There is little variety of food on the menu. Also; the food on the menu is not very tasty.,0
The menu I ordered was served hot; I ate it with my mouth and it was really perfect. But the place is very small and full to the brim. There is no place to sit.,0
They applied extra price because we were tourists; they tried to defraud us officially.,0
Beautifully located restaurant on the beach; very nice staff and very good value for money; would gladly come again.,0
