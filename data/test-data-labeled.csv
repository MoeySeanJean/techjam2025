 When I was about to use the new model Microwave Owen, noticed a bug /insect crawling inside the front panel but I could not get rid of it since it is inside and there is no way to reach it and I was also worried that there might be more hidden inside.I called the hotline and they sent a technician to my house and dismantled the whole microwave oven but could not locate the bug/insect.It might be hidden somewhere inside which the technician could not locate it.This set definitely has to be sanitized and can't be used at all ! I began to doubt Samsung's brand reliability and explained to the agent hotline that I do not want a replacement but I am seeking a full REFUND from Samsung right now and I do not want to support Samsung anymore! I bought this NEW model for CNY uses but right now Samsung is not attending to my issues as I told them I need a confirmation for the refund before I can proceed to buy another new mic rowave oven.Called the agent hotline a few times and spoken to so many Customer Care ( Name: Pinky, Lee and the latest one being Celicia) but was told that a refund report have been submitted to Samsung but I still need to wait !

 Before you spend your money, I urge you to read the 1-star and 2-star reviews here and on Trustpilot. I now understand why so many people have complained. My experience proves that this company does not honour its warranty promises—standard or extended. If your phone develops a fault, they will ignore you rather than repair or replace it.
 
 I purchased an extended warranty for my Samsung S24 Ultra in good faith( Excellent condition ). When problems arose, the service I received was unacceptable:
 
 First issue: Reported more than a week ago. No response to date.
 
 Second issue: Reported by email. Company acknowledged it and promised a reply within 48 working hours. That deadline passed long ago—still no update.
 
 Previously, I removed a negative review to give them another chance. That was a mistake. The delays, silence, and lack of responsibility remain exactly the same. I have now been waiting since late July with no progress.
 
 This is unprofessional, unethical, and a clear disregard for customers’ rights. Their marketing and social media promotions are persuasive, but my experience shows these promises are empty. They have taken my hard-earned money for an extended warranty and delivered nothing in return.
 
 I will be filing formal complaints with the relevant consumer authorities. My advice: do not waste your money here—especially on extended warranties. You risk paying for a service they will never deliver.",0

 I’ve been servicing my car with Quicklane for over 9 years because they always push me into buying their servicing packages — which ties me down to them. In the early years, before they onboarded BYD, their servicing standards were excellent and I was genuinely happy, which is why I kept buying their packages. But even with a package, I always seemed to incur extra charges here and there.
 
 Since they started handling BYD, everything has gone downhill. The CSAs don’t bother replying to messages, and when they finally do, the service attitude is shockingly poor.
 
 My most recent experience was the last straw:
 • After sending my car in for servicing, I had to tow it off the highway just 2 days later.
 • When they couldn’t identify the issue, their “solution” was simply to replace parts at my cost. Convenient, isn’t it?
 • My Bluetooth system issue has dragged on forever — their answer? Replace the entire radio system! What nonsense.
 • Within the SAME month of servicing, my engine light came on. When I asked why this happened right after servicing, they had no proper explanation and instead told me to come down for a diagnostic test — and pay another $70 for it.
 
 Before sending the car in, I never had these issues. Now I’m left with even more problems, extra bills, and no accountability from them.",0

 If you’re around the area, Broadway Food Centre at Sim Lim Square is a super convenient spot to grab a quick and satisfying meal. It’s your typical food court setup with plenty of choices — mixed veg rice, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Malay, you name it. Really handy if you’re in Sim Lim running errands or just looking for a no-frills meal.
 
 This time, I tried the Korean cold noodles — and honestly, it was super refreshing. The broth was chilled and tangy, with that slight sweetness and a nice kick of spice. Noodles had a good chewy texture, and it came with sliced cucumber and egg. Perfect for a hot day! Wasn’t expecting much, but it was surprisingly satisfying.
 
 The food came out quick too, even though the place was quite packed during lunch hour. There’s always a steady crowd, but seating turnover is fast, and it’s air-conditioned, which is a big plus.

While we were choosing food, I saw that the kimchi cup noodles was on discount 1 for 1 so I encouraged my friend to get one with me even though he already planned to get another food item.. as we paid our food together at the counter, i initially didn't calculate the prices properly but after eating I realised that $14plus for 2 cup noodles (which is supposed to be the price of one $3.20) and one chicken wrap $3.80 and one chicken breast $3.10 does not add up to $14 sth which was what she charged us for.. it was supposed to be $10.10 only.
 
 When i went back to tell her and ask her about the price she charged, I realised that all the discount tags that were there were all taken down.. and when I told her I saw it while I was buying she said the discount doesn't exist. Another worker was there and he said that the discounts we saw were expired discounts so it no longer applies. I told them that it's not my fault that they forgot to remove expired discounts and should not have overcharged us for it and not do anything about it but argue back. Now I feel so bad for encouraging my friend to buy the cup noodle when he initially didn't even want to eat it. This lady was so uncooperative and unapologetic so I just left angrily without being compensated whatsoever.
 I hope the 7/11 managers can remind their staff to remove discounts on time and be accountable for their mistakes. As a student who has very limited budget, 7/11 food is already very pricey for me and now with this overcharging I feel very very frustrated and angry about this unpleasant incident.",0

 The worst karaoke experience ever
 
 It’s a Friday night and we arrived at this karaoke place around 9 PM and were given a room that had apparently already started at 9, which we didn’t mind. Not realizing it was a bar setting, we made the mistake of bringing our own drinks. Shortly after starting our session, the 1st female staff member entered to inform us that outside drinks weren’t allowed. We apologized, explained it was our first time there, and we would order food and drinks from the venue. She was understanding and told us not to do it again.
 
 However, things quickly turned ridiculous. Within the next 5 minutes, a 2nd female staff member came in to repeat the same message. We again apologized and reiterated that we had placed orders with them.
 
 Then, less than 2 minutes later, a 3rd male staff member entered to tell us again that outside drinks weren’t allowed and warned he’d come back to check. We complied and placed the drinks into a paper bag. But before even a minute had passed, a fourth staff member entered, this time asking to confiscate our drinks and store them at the counter. We refused, as the drinks were already opened and half-consumed — we had no idea what might happen to them once out of our sight.
 
 Throughout the entire 2-hour session, staff continued to peek into our room repeatedly, making us feel like we were under surveillance. It felt less like a karaoke session and more like being in a monitored holding cell. Aren’t they busy on a Friday night, why would they do it to such extent?
 
 If outside drinks are strictly prohibited, the staff could have simply refused us entry or asked us to leave at the start. Instead, they allowed us in, took our card, and then spent the rest of the time interrupting and policing us, ruining what should have been an enjoyable night.
 
 Absolutely terrible service. I would give zero stars if I could. Avoid this place at all costs",0
Meidi-Ya Supermarket,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Meidi-Ya%20Supermarket&query_place_id=ChIJkcJD6h4Z2jER1jILu0ewCI8,3.0,,,"2025 June update:
 The quality of the sashimi sold here has deteriorated alarmingly. It used to be fine But over the past 2 months or so, something must have changed. Yesterday's 2 trays had a mushy texture and a fishy smell. Something is wrong with the handling or the fish itself. The texture and flavour is just not that of decent (not even saying ""high"") quality sashimi.
 
 2024 July update:
 After visiting the Great World City outlet for a several weeks then coming back here again (because of all the NDP road closures around this side on Saturdays), I would say that the quality and quantity of things in this (Millennia Walk) branch is much better than GWC. This is particularly evident in the Sashimi. Come to this outlet to get your stuff, not the other one!
 
 Earlier review when they 1st moved here:
 
 Stock levels here seem to be far less predictable than when they were at Liang Court. Perhaps it's due to the smaller space, perhaps due to the COVID semi lockdown. I don't know. My frustration for today: no 1L bottle of Mirin. No Jap daikon (only Malaysia). No kawahagi. Haven't seen restock of other dried fish e.g. aji/fugu mirin boshi. Sashimi counter no longer has the tank for the occasional uni and oysters as they did previously. Koji was out of stock on our last trip but ok today.",0

 very bad service I have ever encountered in my life. all three staff I saw are very uncooperative. when asked to look for manager, they said not around. asked for phone number, refused to give. most of them are foreigners. especially the only one male staff there (foreigner).
 I paid thru self service counter but no receipt was issued. asked for assistance but noone come until I approached him. he took a roll of paper suppose to replace but ended up talking to the other two female staffs. I called him then he reluctant to come. took long time to do it. and the machine started printing hundred of receipts. I checked the date it was the previous day receipts. that's mean they never issued receipts to previous hundreds of customers. the manager must be sleeping in their jobs so that his staff behave the same way. after waited for half an hour then he gave me my receipt without the healthy 365 QR codes. when I asked for it. he randomly took from the whole bundle of previous receipts not issued to customers in a crumbled manner and threw at me. he said if I was not happy can complain to manager. when I said I want to see manager, they said not in. I asked for telephone number, they refused to give. he even said want to call police but never and asked me to call police, which I did. the police came and took down particulars and ask me to feed back to the customer service. I will said all your staff has totally no.service quality and need to be retrained and not suitable to deal with front line service. very disappointed that this international outlets dropped to this kind of low standard. I will never and will not recommend any of my friends to visit all outlets under this company. I will also tell them this ridiculous incident.
 
 I insisted that they give me receipt because I wanted to prevent myself being accused of stealing their goods. it is also an offence not to issue receipts to customers let alone hundreds of customers not given receipts. please check with IRAS regulations.",0

 Decent variety of your run of the mill witbiers, though their relatively more special in-house brew, the Helles, was out the night we visited
 
 Ok:
 - Sausage platter. Sausages were okay, if a little salty and not really having enough bite. Mash was way too runny. Sauerkraut out of a jar. Honestly, for a repast that's available this late at night I can't fault them overly much for the TV-dinner quality of food on hand.",0

Century Square 19 June 2025-2130-2245hrs = Coin changing machine not working, cash exchange machine waited 30 mins upon frequent request to fix ignored. After playing one of the toy push displacement machine for an hour, managed to win the red stopper prize. I alerted this Indian maintenance staff (photo-without glasses, light facial stubble, stout built, 5'6"") several times at close range but he deliberately ignored me until I walked right up to him to respond. He snapped back in a hostile manner and replied "" WHAT ?!!"" I calmly told him I won the prize to collect and was shocked he angrily retorted, "" So, shake for it!"". I then firmly repeated to collect my prize. He then went to reset the machine and pass me the prize from the counter. I then calmly requested for his name for reference but again he ignored me. I insisted he provide his name and added that if he felt his hostile attitude was justified, why would he be reluctant to own up to his uncouth behavior. He then challenged me to go report on Facebook when I requested for his name again. He snapped back and instructed I just identify him as ""the Indian guy"". I informed him that there were more than few Indian staff there so his name was required. He then ignored me again. I then calmly snapped a facial photo of him for reference and he turned hostile questioning me several times why I took his photo. I simply smiled and replied, "" So?.. It's for your management."" I firmly stood my ground and paused for his possible retaliation. I definitely wouldn't have had hesitated to call the police had he dared made further threatening movements towards me.
 Anyways, my 2 cents.. If any of your staff is unhappy working there, please tell them, like what locals say, to stay home, shake legs, and don't work to avoid antagonizing good paying customers without cause. As for myself, I'm pretty done tolerating all your bad staff behavior and probably no longer patronize your franchise once I clear my balance tokens, since, from so many bad reviews, nothing seems to be rectified. Last year before closing hours, my bad, I left my pouch with cash filled, Credit cards, ID,.. Etc. wallet overnight at your machine and even calling the 1st morning maintenance staff on opening hours to check. He kept informing nothing found and kept brushing off my concerns claiming very busy. Nevertheless, I personally rushed down to your CS branch to confirm with that Chinese morning staff and I even offered $100 reward to view the cctv. He refused but I demanded to view the cctv to trace the point of my own negligence or I'll call the police. He relented. Once it was clear the cctv showed the night staff found it, that morning staff miraculously revealed that my bag suddenly appeared and was found and placed under the cash register. It was not there before. I still kept my integrity and gave him the$100 reward to share with the honest Malay night staff , despite knowing I could have easily called the police on his intentions to keep my bag after viewing the cctv. So much for your staff professionalism. Do better.",0

 As a comparison, we purchased both Maguro and Salmon Belly from the various supermarkets and Meidi-Ya came out tops with deeper flavours while the others were somewhat bland.
 
 We enjoy the beef cuts as well and can never resist going overboard, planning for yakiniku feasts over the weekends.
 
 The wagyu beef chuck is a sure bet, beautifully marbled and assuredly soft. It only requires a 30-second sear before slinging it into your gob.
 
 The pork jowls are also a must-have but it always needs a little seasoning to stand up to the rich flavoured cuts of beef. We even grab the yusheng from them because we trust the freshness.
 
 I would, however, steer clear of any fruits they have on sale. They are on sale for a reason and we learnt it the hard way.
 
 In any case, our pampered feline used to love her tiny morsels of Maguro and Sake from Meidi-Ya and just for those precious memories alone, I'll admit I'm biased and have a fondness for this supermarket. It's, after all, my furry baby's choice.",0

Spoke to her about my body aching areas and she was very well attentive to them. She knows how to provide deep press massages, and helped to relief off a lot of air pockets from my daily workout stints on my arms, ribs, thighs etc. Her number of experience years in this field tells it all.
 
 To know my physical challenges, I always have to walk a lot daily during my outdoor work covering some distances of 3km to 5km and i additionally perform my weekly weekend runs abt 5km to 10kms.
 
 I looked out for the reliefs and recovery after all the pain pressed from the massages and she did very well from applying any kind of overstressing pressure on my muscles and joints.
 
 Plus i felt so much better in terms of gaining more energy and ease of more physical mobility after having a few hours rest at home after the session.
 
 Im now more than ever looking forward to having more sessions with her in the future.
 
 Thank you Soul Spa for having one of the most experienced staff like Jesy! 👍👍👍👍👍",0

 He kept asking me to call the Changi outlet because ""this outlet is in town and not at Changi"" when I was only asking a simple question of whether I can trade in the device or not, and told me I just have to call them and don't need to go all the way down.
 
 When I asked whether I can come to this outlet to trade in or I have to go back to Changi because I bought it there, he told me again ""this outlet is in town and not at Changi so need to call Changi."" No clue what the hell the location of the branch has to do with my question. Tone of this person was extremely disinterested and unhelpful and he did not even bother to offer to call on my behalf, or to ask me to wait so he can check with someone who has a clue.
 
 100% will avoid this outlet. I called the Changi outlet and they were very helpful and equally puzzled when I told them the Holland outlet told me I had to call them. Afterwards, called the Jem outlet afterwards to confirm if I could bring my device in to trade in there and they were very helpful with confirming as well as answering my scenarios.
 
 Awful service level and a stain on iStudio's reputation as an Apple Premium Partner. If he told me to call the other outlet because he wasn't sure, still OK, instead kept feeding me nonsense about ""this outlet is in town"". LOL",0

 I would like to express my disappointment regarding an experience I had earlier today at your Redhill branch. I approached the clinic to inquire about an appointment for tomorrow, and unfortunately, I was met with unhelpful and unfriendly service (no greeting no apology) from the staff at the front desk, Shannon.
 
 As a pregnant individual who made a special trip to the clinic seeking assistance, I expected a basic level of courtesy and support. However, Shannon did not offer a greeting, showed no willingness to accommodate my concerns, and overall made the interaction frustrating and disheartening. This lack of professionalism is especially disappointing given Minmed’s reputation for accessible and caring healthcare.

 I personally feel this service by “TY” is top notch.
 He is very and I mean very patience with me when I asked him questions about phones regarding specs etc . You can try going to SingTel / M1 shop you won’t get this kind of service .
 He will carefully access your budget / your daily use of phone and how you’re going to use it, based on that then he will recommend which phone is suitable for you. But at the end of the day he will tell me . Ultimately is need to see whether I can accept the branding of the phone, no pressure / hard selling from this guy , felt very comfortable during the whole interaction .
 
 Give this guy a thumbs up👍 will come back again to this man if I were to buy a new phone again .",0

 My grandfather went to this shop for help with his SIM card issue. He had accidentally blocked his SIM by entering the wrong PUK code. The proper procedure would have been to resolve the SIM card issue or replace it, but instead, the shop dismantled every component of his phone and then put it back together again. They charged my grandfather $30 without even solving the SIM card problem.
 
 Is it right to scam the elderly like this? I'm concerned that this shop is located in a mature estate. How many more elderly people are they going to exploit?
 
 大家，尤其是叔叔阿姨们！这间是一个骗人的店！别被评论骗了！
 
 我爷爷去这家店求助，解决他的SIM卡问题。他不小心输入了错误的PUK码，导致SIM卡被锁了。正确的做法应该是解决SIM卡问题或更换SIM卡，但这家店却把他手机的所有部件都拆了，然后又重新装回去。他们甚至都没解决SIM卡问题，就收了我爷爷30块钱。
 
 这样骗老人合适吗？我担心这家店开在有很多老人的区。他们还要剥削多少老人？
 
 AMARAN SEMUA TERUTAMA PAKAK DAN MAKCIK! INI ADALAH KEDAI SCAM! Jangan tertipu dengan ulasan!
 
 Datuk saya pergi ke kedai ini untuk mendapatkan bantuan mengenai isu kad SIMnya. Dia telah menyekat SIMnya secara tidak sengaja dengan memasukkan kod PUK yang salah. Prosedur yang betul adalah untuk menyelesaikan isu kad SIM atau menggantikannya, tetapi sebaliknya, kedai itu membongkar setiap komponen telefonnya dan kemudian meletakkannya semula. Mereka mengenakan bayaran kepada datuk saya SGD 30 tanpa menyelesaikan masalah kad SIM.
 
 Betul ke menipu warga emas begini? Saya bimbang kedai ini terletak di estet matang. Berapa ramai lagi orang tua yang akan mereka eksploitasi?

 என் தாத்தா தனது சிம் கார்டு பிரச்சினைக்கு உதவி கேட்க இந்தக் கடைக்குச் சென்றார். தவறான PUK குறியீட்டை உள்ளிட்டு அவர் தற்செயலாக தனது சிம்மைத் தடுத்தார். சிம் கார்டு சிக்கலைத் தீர்ப்பது அல்லது அதை மாற்றுவதுதான் சரியான நடைமுறையாக இருந்திருக்கும், ஆனால் அதற்கு பதிலாக, கடை அவரது தொலைபேசியின் ஒவ்வொரு கூறுகளையும் பிரித்து மீண்டும் ஒன்றாக இணைத்தது. சிம் கார்டு சிக்கலைக் கூட தீர்க்காமல் என் தாத்தாவிடம் $30 வசூலித்தனர்.
 
 இப்படி முதியவர்களை ஏமாற்றுவது சரியா? இந்தக் கடை ஒரு முதிர்ந்த எஸ்டேட்டில் அமைந்திருப்பது எனக்கு கவலையாக இருக்கிறது. இன்னும் எத்தனை முதியவர்களை அவர்கள் சுரண்டப் போகிறார்கள்?",0

The day after we noticed that they were many bugs (BED BUGS) and even more black spots (bed bugs remains) meaning that there’s a untreated infestation. We alerted the staff and they told us that it was the first time that something like this had happened but after further analysis we noticed that they were many complains about bed bugs in the past month (July). I find it very unsanitary that they made us change rooms while maybe transporting the bed bugs with us. We didn’t even get a refund for the inconvenience even if we did pay about 135$ per night.

 My recent visit to Fusion Spa in Jurong was, without a doubt, the worst massage experience I've ever had. What started as a booked 1-hour Chinese massage quickly turned into a masterclass in miscommunication, aggressive upselling, and deeply unprofessional conduct.
 The therapist, ""Mandy"" (who was far from the ""overrated"" service I expected), somehow converted my 1-hour session into a 30-minute oil massage – even with a translator, I couldn't understand why this change happened. To add insult to injury, that 30-minute session was effectively only 20 minutes of actual massage time.
 Her focus seemed less on therapy and more on money. She relentlessly pushed for ""extra services"" and tips, and when I declined, the quality of the massage noticeably plummeted. The situation became truly alarming when she attempted to pull off my underwear and explicitly solicited an ""extra service"" for an additional $50. I firmly refused this shocking and inappropriate offer, as I was there for a legitimate massage, nothing more.
 This establishment is overpriced, employs hard-sell tactics, and the level of unprofessionalism is frankly appalling. Save your money and your peace of mind – avoid Fusion Spa Jurong.

I like that it’s not too sweet, and the texture was slightly softer, maybe because it was served hot. If you like to drink and are looking for a chill and cozy place to vibe with your friends, LUSS is the place to go. They have an extensive range of alcoholic drinks; you will definitely be spoiled for choices. The staff were friendly, attentive, and approachable.

 **Review of Jap-Kor Stall Experience**
 
 My recent visit to the Jap-Kor stall left undesired. We ordered a bean paste soup with tofu, only to find that the tofu was sour and spoiled upon tasting. Politely informing the staff and we requested to change our order to kimchi soup, which they agreed to without additional charge, claiming it was the same price.
 
 However, what disappointed me was the attitude of the stall attendants. When I questioned the reuse of the same soup for the kimchi soup, one of the ladies seemed indifferent, which was off-putting. Despite my request for a fresh batch of soup, the discussion became unnecessarily prolonged. The presence of the banmian auntie, who was involved in collecting money, added to the awkwardness as she defended the quality of the tofu without addressing our concerns effectively.
 
 The continuous insistence that the tofu wasn't spoiled, accompanied by attempts to blame the bean paste, did not resolve the issue professionally. Eventually, I decided to end the conversation by asking for the soup to be returned, hinting at leaving a negative review online. This seemed to catch them off guard, resulting in an uncomfortable silence.
 
 Overall, while the food options seemed promising, the customer service and handling of complaints at the Jap-Kor stall were disappointing.",0

 Due to coming CNY, I need to have a microwave oven for use but it seems unlikely to have one as all of you are wasting my time and not offering any solutions at all .
 
 In that case, my last resort is to write and feedback this bad experience on Google review and FACEBOOK .",0

This expectation was highly unrealistic and did not take into account her age, physical condition, and the fact that she was experiencing vomiting/back pain.
 Such requests can cause unnecessary stress to elderly patients and may even worsen their condition. I believe clinics should prioritise compassion, patience, and understanding when dealing with vulnerable patients, especially seniors.

 The waiter told me, “Come on lah, bro, this is my regular customer, I’ll take care of it,” while patting me on the shoulder.

 The café is tucked away inside an industrial building, 100 Pasir Panjang, which gives it a bit of a “hidden gem” feel. From café, you get a clear view overlooking West Coast Highway, and for those driving, there’s plenty of parking available at the B1 carpark.
 
 When we arrived, the café was packed, clearly a popular spot for the holiday eve. We had to wait quite a while for a table, but the staff’s hospitality made the wait far more pleasant. The server kindly offered us the comfy sofa seats on Level 2, where we could relax, chat, before our table was available.
 
 I opted for the set lunch menu, which was reasonably priced given the quality. I went for the Modena pizza, a thin crust, light yet flavourful sauce, and toppings that tasted fresh and organic. It was the kind of pizza that doesn’t try too hard but wins you over with its honest, wholesome flavours.

 No questions asked. His son William just quietly diagnosed the problem and fixed what was needed. Uncle Roy could have said 'change all 4 sensors' and i will do it as it would be deemed necessary but no, he said 'change only the 1 of the sensor will do'

I came in as a walk-in at 730am today right before the opening time at 8am because I was vomiting badly and feeling extremely lightheaded in the morning. I’ve also been visiting this clinic for an eye infection, so it made sense to come back here.
 
 At the registration counter, I told the Chinese lady that I was feeling very unwell and couldn’t go to a GP because I was lightheaded and could throw up anytime. I also explained that I’m on ComCare and can’t afford to go to a private clinic. Still, she said they will only see case that is urgent and that the doctor’s schedule was fully booked, and just told me to buy medicine from the pharmacy.
 
 But I’d already taken medicine, and I needed a doctor to assess what was actually wrong. I felt helpless.
 
 I’m really grateful to the Indian lady near the self-check-in kiosk who saw how pale I looked and told me to keep checking the app for any available slots. She was the only one who showed concern when I could barely see clearly anymore.
 
 It’s frustrating and disheartening to be turned away when you’re visibly unwell. The least u could do is make an effort and go an extra mile.I hope they can better assess such situations, especially for those of us facing financial difficulties.",0

Wife had an iced cafe latte, daughter a flat white. All beverages 10/10.

 The place is like a three ring circus with lots of things going on. There is the courtyard outdoor area where we were seated (inside was full at 10 am on a Tuesday). It is open during the day and transforms into a beer garden in the evenings, providing a different atmosphere.
 
 There is the indoor seated aircon area dubbed the coffee bar: A U-shaped bar where baristas prepare coffee, offering a 360-degree view of the brewing process. It also features an all-day menu with baked goods.
 
 There is the Annex, a retail space where customers can find a range of coffee products, accessories, and equipment. Coffee specialists are available to provide advice and guidance. Then there is the roastery. This area is dedicated to the process of roasting coffee beans, showcasing the journey from bean to cup. What really caught my attention at CSHH was the massive Probat 45G Roaster.
 
 The Probate G45 Roaster designed to handle a batch capacity of 45 Kg, although the staff told me they prefer to process a maximum of 30 kg of coffee beans at a time.

She would only pack when I pass her my bags and ask for her help while I make payment or putting my cash into my wallet.
 
 Never ever have I wanted to complain about her but base on my last experience is my last drawn with her. I asked her to help me to pack my groceries while I put my money back into my purse (I have pack half of it myself) and yet, she went ahead and process transaction for other customer.

 Other staffs usually help me pack my groceries into my bags without me asking for their help. That includes cashier staffs at FairPrice or Cold Storage.
 
 I think, it is part of their respnsibilities to pack for their customer whethet they pay for plastic bag or using their own shopping bag. Unless Giants has a different policy.

 I am an athlete and have done a lot of physiotherapy / osteopathic work in London and SG, and Seamus is by far the best.
 He understands the anatomy of human body inside - out; he treats the core issue, as opposed to “doing patch up work”; he does Not push you for more than needed sessions (rare for SG).
 I’ve been seeing him for at least once a week sessions, and sometimes even 2 sessions a week. He has helped me run SG marathon in 3.30hrs, with no injury what so ever.
 I rarely write these reviews, but Seamus 100% deserves it.
 Thank you for everything and I look forward to new achievements in 2024!",0

MY Clinic,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=MY%20Clinic&query_place_id=ChIJ362im4gQ2jER1B4Ha1C38fQ,1.0,,,"I only used this clinic because they were the only ones in my neighbourhood on my corporate insurance panel. Pretty average standard level of expertise for GPs. The doctors there are friendly enough, although the clinic always looked messy.
 
 I opted to use them for Healthier SG programme, after the lead GP sold me a very nice pitch. that was in Dec 2023. I was also encouraged to email them, which i did. I sent an email on 2 Jan 2024, which went on to be unanswered for MONTHS. Follow up emails and even phone calls were unanswered and when I finally managed to get through, it was already 19 July 2023. All i got from the receptionist Lavina was ""did you?"" when I told her about the email.
 
 So apparently no one checks the only email account of the clinic but Lavina. Either that, my email is not deemed important enough to open. In the end, my treatment was kept in status quo and I didnt start my HSG programme till much later.
 
 When queried, all i got was a very insincere ""As spoken on the phone on 20 July 2024, we have conveyed our apologies and we are again sorry to hear of the cost concerns with your specialist"", without the lead GP even acknowleging that his team messed up and dropped the ball on me. The fact that my emails and calls were unanswered for more than 7 months was the MAIN ISSUE, which the clinic didnt want to address. I am pretty sure if i hadnt called, it would have gone on to remain unanswered.
 
 I was told in an email on 22 July 2024 that the delay was due to the clinic having to ""clarify a few things with ALPs and AIC as to the drugs eligible under HSG"". It must have been arduous, having to require more than 7 months.
 
 I have since enrolled with another clinic for HSG. They are further away from my home, but at least the Physician there follows up on me regularly.

Samsung Electronics,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Samsung%20Electronics&query_place_id=ChIJU5w0UL8b2jER4jpAF-P7-JU,1.0,,,"I purchased a brand-new Samsung S24 Ultra, expecting a premium product and service to match. Instead, I’ve been met with nothing but frustration and disappointment.
 
 Straight out of the box, the phone's camera was completely non-functional—a glaring hardware defect. For a device that is supposed to represent the pinnacle of Samsung’s innovation, this was an appalling start.
 
 When I contacted Samsung, I made what I believe was a simple and reasonable request: an immediate replacement for a brand-new, defective product. To my shock, Samsung refused and insisted I take the phone to their service center for evaluation and potential repair. This demand is utterly unacceptable. Why should I, as a paying customer, have to jump through hoops to repair a product that was faulty from the start?
 
 I escalated the issue, hoping for a better resolution. Two days later, Samsung called back—only to repeat the same unhelpful response: no replacement, only repair. Their refusal to offer a replacement demonstrates a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. A company of Samsung’s stature should have a no-questions-asked replacement policy for defective products.
 
 As if that wasn’t bad enough, the first customer service agent handling my case refused to provide his/her name when asked, showing a total lack of transparency and accountability. This evasive and dismissive behavior further underscores the inadequacies in Samsung’s customer service.
 
 This entire ordeal—from receiving a defective product to the appallingly poor customer service—has left me deeply disappointed. For anyone considering buying from Samsung, be warned: if something goes wrong, you’ll be left to deal with a frustrating and unsympathetic system. This experience has seriously made me reconsider my loyalty to the brand.
 
 Verdict: Avoid. Samsung's handling of this situation has been nothing short of a disaster.",0

 Terrible, painful experience with arrogant, unhelpful staff.

 Secondly, collected the car, mirror was jerky. They assured me it was a new part issue, tried to put some oil but issue was not resolved.
 
 Lastly and the worse part, I just discovered these incapable staff curbed my rim when my car was with them and painted it over black which was why I didn't realise when I collected the car.

Even though i explain the issue, They quoted me a high price (216sgd) and i asked why too high just to replace Charging Port and they added an issue with the screen need to repair as well, then i explain it was properly working before it went lowbatt and i daid the only issue is not charging,, then he realized that i know the issue he changed his mind telling that the Tablet frame have issue,, i Beg them just fix the charging port or i buy the sparepart of it but they said cannot fix only 1 item,, they insist to fix the frame or screen, i realized they just want to increase my payment so i just left. After that, I brought the tablet to a regular repair shop and had it fixed for only SGD 80. The technician there confirmed that there was no issue with the screen or frame at all.
 
 I feel disappointed that the service center’s. As a customer, I expect transparency, fair pricing, and honest assessments since its a Samsung service centre. I hope Samsung can improve the quality and integrity of their service at this branch.",0
Central 24-Hr Clinic (Clementi) - CHAS | GP Clinic | 24 小时 诊所,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Central%2024-Hr%20Clinic%20(Clementi)%20-%20CHAS%20%7C%20GP%20Clinic%20%7C%2024%20%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%20%E8%AF%8A%E6%89%80&query_place_id=ChIJLRgm1I0a2jER056txf2zC6o,1.0,,,"I visited this clinic in the hope of avoiding a trip to the A&E, but the experience turned out to be one of the most appalling I’ve ever encountered in a healthcare setting.
 
 Before arriving, my husband called ahead to explain that I was in severe pain and to check if the clinic could assist. The receptionist who answered was shockingly rude — no greeting, no courtesy, just a blunt “What do you want?” That should have been the first red flag, but we held on to hope that once there, we would receive proper medical attention.
 
 When we arrived and I informed the same receptionist that I was in intense pain, she didn’t even look up or acknowledge me with any concern. Instead, she continued chatting with another patient about billing instructions. Only after that did she turn to me — not to direct me to the doctor, but to insist on registering my IC and taking down my particulars. This, despite my repeated pleas and visible distress.
 
 I had to reason with her — that surely I could be seen by the doctor first and the administrative steps could wait until I was stable. Her lack of urgency and basic empathy was both disturbing and unacceptable.
 
 But what truly shocked me was the doctor’s response. After a brief glance, he immediately said, “I can’t help you, you need to go to A&E.” There was no attempt to assess, no first-aid measures, no questions — just a quick dismissal. And to make matters worse, he criticised me for being agitated due to the pain, telling me I shouldn’t behave that way. I cannot understand how a medical professional could lack such fundamental compassion and empathy. No help rendered. Continued sitting at his chair.
 
 This entire experience was deeply traumatic, not just because of the pain I was in, but because of how dehumanising the encounter felt. There was zero empathy, zero professionalism — from the receptionist to the doctor.
 
 If this is how you treat patients in distress, you have no place in the healthcare profession. I strongly advise others to avoid this clinic at all costs. It is simply unacceptable.
 
 The only saving grace was one young staff who helped to call the ambulance. Thank you for your kind help.
 
 For the corporate office: this incident occurred on Saturday, 26 July, at approximately 3:00PM. Please investigate accordingly. The staff and doctor on duty should be held accountable.",0

 When my wife and I arrived at the store, it was late in the evening and relatively quiet. We appreciated that the sales staff noticed us but gave us some time to settle in and browse comfortably before approaching. This thoughtful approach stood out to us, especially since my wife usually prefers not to be approached too quickly.
 
 We were interested in a gold bangle, and Olivia assisted us throughout the process with professionalism, politeness, and well-mannered service. She even suggested other designs that paired well with the bangle we were considering.
 
 Thanks to Olivia’s helpful recommendations, we ended up purchasing the gold bangle along with a matching ring she suggested. We’re extremely happy with her service—she was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.
 
 I highly recommend Top Cash Little India—and particularly Olivia—to anyone looking for gold jewelry.

I spotted a lady at the meat section but wasn’t sure if she was also responsible for the bread, so I simply continued waiting, I wasn’t upset or in a hurry, just calmly looking for someone to help.
 
 Unexpectedly, the lady from the meat section walked over and said to me in a rude tone, “Don’t know how to open your mouth and ask? No one knows you need anything if you don’t ask.” I was taken aback by her attitude, but I calmly pointed to the bread I wanted and asked her to help cut it.
 
 After she finished, she repeated the same rude comment again about how if I didn’t open my mouth, no one would know, again, in a condescending tone.
 
 I want to emphasize that I really wasn’t angry or trying to find fault at all about not being attended to. But the way she spoke to me, completely unprovoked, was unnecessary and frankly, quite upsetting. Her tone and choice of words turned what was a perfectly normal situation into an unpleasant one.

 I was trying to be polite by making a small talk with her, so I casually asked her if Tillamook is a new Cheese brand. But her response really shocked me.
 
 She turned her head in a dramatic slow-mo, rolled her eyes at me as she said “huhhh……?” “no…..?” “It’s been around for so long already, you didn’t hear before meh?” She said so much yet she could not tell me exactly which year was the brand founded.
 
 So she was rude and judgmental towards me when I have not heard of the brand, yet she herself as a promoter of Tillamook, don’t know when it’s founded?
 
 Isn’t the point of being a promoter, to promote and share more about the brand to customers? What’s the point of hiring one when the promoter was so judgemental yet clueless about the brand?
 
 I’m sure the reason why she’s even hired to promote at the temporary booth at CS is because the brand is unpopular and they want to make it known to CS customers, so it’s not surprising that I haven’t heard of the brand.
 
 This encounter with the female promoter really ruined my shopping experience at CS. I’d rather patronise Fairprice Finest in future.

How long does it take to pour a glass from a tap. It was clear that the service was really disappointing and it almost felt like some other customers were being given priority.
 3. The fries never came btw. 30-45 mins of sitting there, no one said anything, Enquired and was told 'oh there's only one chef today. Could have given a heads-up before taking the order or at least told us while we were waiting forever just to have fries along with Beer.

 A few weeks ago, someone had spilled a drink on the floor. As I was pushing a trolley and unknowingly approached the area, this staff member stood nearby and abruptly shouted “Oi!” before pointing at the spill. His expression was extremely hostile!
 almost as if to say, “Are you blind?” It was unnecessarily aggressive and humiliating.
 
 On another occasion, I witnessed him act rudely toward a couple browsing at the bakery section. He arrived with multiple carts and attempted to push through a narrow space without saying “Excuse me” or asking politely. Instead, he glared at the couple with an exaggerated, wide-eyed stare, silently pressuring them to move. Startled, they quickly stepped aside. It was uncomfortable to witness.
 
 Later, when I went to pay for my items, I told the cashier that I’d return shortly to grab a few more packs of blueberries. I placed my cart aside temporarily. This same staff member then ordered me to push my cart over and return to the bakery area, even though I had already informed the cashier of my plan. It felt controlling and unnecessary.
 
 Fortunately, another staff member noticed and kindly offered to help move my cart. His helpful attitude stood in stark contrast to the rude behavior I’ve described.
 
 Staff training and professionalism are essential to the shopping experience. Customers should never feel intimidated or disrespected. I sincerely hope CS Fresh takes this feedback seriously and addresses this individual’s behavior appropriately.",0

 For the Thai food:

 2. The pandan chicken is also good -- it is well-marinated and juicy.
 
 For the Ban Mian/Fish soup stall:
 1. The double fish soup is good. You can opt for milk to be put in as well. 2. The dumplings are also good. It is filled with a mixture of chives and pork and is juicy.
 3. The tomato egg noodle is good too. It is like ban mian, except that the soup base is sweet and slightly tangy.
 
 For the La Mian/Hotplate stall, they have beef noodle. The beef slices are tender, but maybe, the spicy option would be better, as the non-spicy option made the soup tasted salty.
 
 For the Waffles stall, they have the waffle with ice cream. The waffle itself is crispy. The ice cream flavors are also quite good -- I particularly liked the cookies and cream and the mango.",0

 I bought a voucher on Grab and the terms and condition only stated that the voucher should be redeemed on either Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. I went on a Saturday night, and showed them that I was there to redeem my voucher. The staff at the entrance told me I couldn’t use it because they had a special guest that night and wanted to 'avoid losses.'
 
 When I asked which terms and conditions could prevent me from entering because of the presence of special guests, they told me it's their decision now and they would inform Grab partnership team next time. It becomes my own problem and I should deal with Grab myself instead!
 
 Interestingly, the staff then admitted that the voucher is a clickbait as they don't want the customer to redeem the voucher, even though the voucher has stated that it should be redeemed within the specified day and period.
 
 Does this imply that Zouk being a big and trusted corporation are playing click bait to cheat the customers? This is not only unprofessional but also completely disregards the rights of your customers!
 
 When I asked to record their statement to raise dispute against Grab, one of the staff touched my phone and raised her tone towards me. This is completely unacceptable. First, did you have permission to touch my personal property? Second, how can you not take responsibility for what you've said, yet still represent Zouk?
 
 I asked for their manager's email and emailed them the day after. But even after 4 days, there's no reply at all. So GO AT YOUR OWN RISK!",0

 The staff are all young, locals, mostly studying at colleges, and consequently really know their way around town - they're really helpful and super friendly too. If you ever have a day where you don't have much to do, relax in their common area - its the ultimate way to meet new people and make some awesome friends! All in all, a really good place to stay.
 This is also one of the very few places in Singapore that i know of that doesn't burn through one's holiday money simply on accommodation costs.

 However, there is 1 issue we need to highlight.
 
 We sat next to the bar counter, on the first table when guests first enter and walk up the steps.
 Everything was perfect except when eating the cake halfway, my wife bit on a staple bullet which she managed to extract from her mouth.
 
 Thankfully, there was no injury or bleeding and we highlighted it to the waiter (Malay gentleman) who was very apologetic, immediately removed the cake and offered us a mocktail each FOC.
 We had a lovely evening and do not want one negative issue to mar the whole experience.
 Hence its unfortunate that this happened and hope you can investigate or highlight this with your birthday cake vendor to ensure that it doesnt happen again (I'm sure they can figure out where the staple bullet originated from).
 
 Unfortunately, we were too shocked and forgot to take a photo, but just writing a note here for the record.
 Post-dinner, i wrote an email to followup and close off this matter but did not receive a reply.
 Hope it has been investigated and resolved. Ideally, i would have liked a refund on the cake alone too. It doesnt seem right to have paid for a cake with a staple bullet and which was thrown away half eaten.",0

 The managers was telling me that so sadly that your name and phone number of the bottle had been redeemed. Which I can also said that your staff use my name and phone number keyed into your system and told me that the bottle had been redeemed! At the end of the day they just came back to me that our system showed your name had redeemed and did not do any further service recovery!
 
 The other sad things about it was yesterday we open beer tower and the promo is 2+1 they are conflict also. Total we had 2+1(3sets) plus 1 tower which mean we total have 10 tower but we counted that everytime we asked for the 2+1 when after served the 2 tower the other 1 tower the staff will told us that we had redeemed but we was not redeemed yet.

Short walk to Boat Quay & Clark Quay, China Town & Centre Business District.Checked in on a Sunday evening. It was very quiet. Staff informed me that the pub upstairs doesn't operate on Sundays. This Capsule/Pod Hostel is newly opened wef Jan 2024. Hence, the aircons are very powerful, extremely clean and comfortable beddings, clean bathrooms. Except you need to go out of the main entrance to use the toilets and hv to key in a separate set password to enter the toilets. There is a big fridge next to the entrance for guests to use. Free coffee, tea, milo and water at the pantry. Area is safe, although there is a pub upstairs. ADD ON ： Extended my stay for another 2 nights, and realised that once after 12 midnight there is less noise from pub as live band stops. You can hear fade music at Room B ( the 16 female pods) but I solved it by listening to music on my earpiece and I usually sleep at 1 am hence it doesnt affect me as much. I think it will be quieter at Room A ( mixed pods) as it is further away. I paid around $38 per night and stayed at a corner lower deck pod. It is definitely value for money if you are looking at a clean capsule hotel at a good location. Honestly, throughout the 3 nights, I slept well, there wasn't any noise from the other pods as this place is relatively new hence it is not fully occupied thus not many people walking in and out.",0

 Variety is less, 916 gold price much higher than market price. But there's no MC nor GST charges. Therefore when calculate with other jewelry shops, its still cheaper and you get to save more.
 There's an option to pay via 3 month installment with no interest fee..
 If more than 3 month then there's 0.7% interest added (which is reasonable).
 Can walk in to pay any date within the month, flexible.

Asked him if my car should be tow to his workshop or I am still able to drive there. He advised driving slowly to the workshop and if there are any problems, I can contact him immediately. Managed to reached his workshop at about 3.30pm. As it is still CNY's holidays, his workshop has only 1 mechanic, otherwise he would have 3 to 4 mechanics. His partner in business spoke to me when I arrived there, and directly me to Junyang. Both him and his partner are customer's oriented persons and very sociable. They will interact with customers and explain clearly the problems with their cars and what needed to be done and the cost of the repairs before proceeding with the repairs. They price is very reasonable. As they do not store a lot of spare parts in their small workshop, they have to ordered from their regular suppliers. Despite that, they are able to diagnosed my car's problems within 30 minutes (4pm). Luckily the problems were my spark plugs and ignition coils, and not my ECU. I agreed on the cost of the repairs and I drove my car home at 5 plus, despite there were many customers at his workshop. His mechanic is very skilled, knowledgeable and friendly as well.

 I am writing to express my deepest appreciation for the exceptional service provided by Mr. Nasir from Quick Lane who serves at Sime Darby / Vantage Automotive Ltd at Alexandra .
 
 On 21st July 2025 at 4:30 PM , my car broke down in my estate carpark. In this stressful situation, I contacted Mr. Nasir, who responded promptly and patiently .He expertly guided me through identifying potential causes of the breakdown, demonstrating remarkable knowledge and professionalism. His calm and reassuring approach immediately gave me peace of mind.
 
 My vehicle was towed to the Quick Lane workshop at Alexandra, where Mr. Nasir continued to provide outstanding support. He kept me informed throughout the diagnostic process and promptly explained the issue of my car failure was due to the gear lever cable assembly had failed, preventing the engine from starting.
 
 Despite the workshop being exceptionally busy with numerous maintenance services , Mr. Nasir coordinate very well with his technical team and repaired my car efficiently, replacing the new gear lever cable assembly and my car was tested ok . He also proactively followed up on my car scheduled routine service, ensuring I was reminded and well-informed.
 
 Mr. Nasir’s expertise, dedication, and customer-centric attitude truly exceeded my expectations. I am thoroughly delighted with his excellent service.
 
 I believed Mr. Nasir for his excellence , he embodies the highest standards of Quick Lane commitment to customer care.
 
 Mr. Nasir , I thank you for fostering such a professional and reliable service environment . Keep it up and well done 👍🙏",0

 Also, shoutout to the fact that they have an OUTDOOR SMOKING AREA — yes!!! You can actually step out, get some air, and still be part of the vibe. It's little things like this that make a night out feel just right.

 We were told that there was a bustling crowd right before we came, so 9pm seems to be the quietest time, in case anyone has the same idea for a date!
 
 The food: We ordered the Pasta, Mala, Pork Belly Skewers, Crab Meat and Buns, two Mocktails, and the Cheese Platter. Each one was as good as the next, and the prices were very reasonably priced for the amazing quality.
 
 The place: The restaurant is situated around a quiet, off the road curb, with stairs leading up to it. It is nested within beautiful nature, with air-conditioned indoor seating, and outdoor seating as well. The restaurant's manager, I believe, was extremely accommodating, and we spoke for a bit. She also adjusted the air-condition for us when we felt chilly.
 
 Before we left, she gave us two roses, which are very appreciated =)
 
 Overall, the whole experience was just really, really pleasant. This will be our new date night spot, and honestly we wanted to gatekeep this...but we also want this place to thrive, so there you go! Visit this place, you will not regret it.

Upon arrival at midnight, the complete lack of signage for the establishment made finding it an exasperating experience. Exhausted from travel, I finally located the place with the assistance of a helpful stranger – on the top floor of a building where even other tenants seemed unaware of its existence.
 
 The frustration continued at the check-in. There was no staffed front desk, and the information provided by the staff regarding check-in details was incomplete and ultimately unusable. Two other guests faced similar issues, struggling with incorrect access codes. Thankfully, another guest assisted us in deciphering the unclear instructions, a process that consumed a frustrating thirty minutes. Despite repeated attempts to reach staff through the Agoda app, no assistance was provided.
 
 The deficiencies continued within the capsule room itself. The extreme lack of ventilation and absence of at least a small fan inside the capsule made for an uncomfortably hot environment. Even with the curtain partially open for a semblance of air circulation, the temperature remained stifling. As if the physical discomfort wasn't enough, the night was plagued by excessive noise. Loud karaoke music from a nearby bar echoed through the walls throughout the early hours, hindering sleep. Furthermore, the capsule design offered minimal soundproofing, allowing even minor noises from other guests to easily disrupt the tranquility of the room.
 
 The final indignity came in the form of the shared bathroom. Located outside the hotel itself, it was a dirty and inconvenient communal facility. This unsanitary situation was the final straw. The next morning, I promptly checked out, deeply dissatisfied with the entire experience. This stay fell far short of even the most basic hospitality standards. If you prioritize comfort and a well-maintained environment, I strongly recommend avoiding this accommodation entirely.",0

Accord Auto Services Pte Ltd,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Accord%20Auto%20Services%20Pte%20Ltd&query_place_id=ChIJ4eltCMwb2jERbEbipz5Z3-U,5.0,,,"MY THOUGHTS ON ACCORD AUTO SERVICES @ 09 JUN 2025
 
 I visited Accord Auto Services (Accord) at its 1009 Bukit Merah Lane workshop Monday, 02 June 2025 before my travel on Sat, 07 June 2025 and I like to share my good impressions on the competence and professionalism of the team especially, Gilbert and Ah Hao.
 
 I observed that Accord has the precise BMW diagnostic tools and professional expertise to diagnose and systematically assess “the morning cold start idling” issue which I have been experiencing for a few months.
 
 From checks and research thus far, I understand that the cold start issue (apparently common to many older BMW cars) could be caused by (1) some faulty ECU sensors; or/and (2) clogged fuel injector/sin cylinders; and/or (3) overnight fuel injectors’ bleeding…
 
 I must say that I truly appreciate the Accord service team’s professional diligence and comprehensive cum thorough diagnosis of the car’s engine and ECU sensors. The diagnostic process took about two odd hours and the Accord team managed to diagnose that the Nitrogen Oxide or NOx sensor [which was replaced in July 2023 by another workshop but unsure if that NOx sensor replaced then had been correctly coded] is faulty and unwittingly send erroneous signals to the ECU and causing the morning cold start and (unfortunate cum annoying) rough idling issue …
 
 On the very next day, Tue, 03 Jun 2025, the Accord team promptly texted the quote and estimated downtime to replace the NOx sensor. As I am travelling now, I look forward to arranging the NOx sensor replacement with Accord when I return from my travel in late June 2025.
 
 I shall also try to update/ cross-share and cross-learn further for those who have same or other engine issues concerning their BMW cars.",0

While it is not ideal that timing to collect my car post serving is longer than expected, it is not a major inconvenience. Was advised to change my tyres which I did. Only to be told when I collect my car that there was a ""miscommunication"" between auto sprint and supplier that I have to come back another day to do my two rear tyres because they received the wrong sizes. And then was told that I need to have a newer model of tyres for my rear tyres versus what was initially quoted else they will have to remove the front ones that were ready fixed. The logic is simply flawed and does not make sense. Moreover, it meant I have to come back another day and waste more time because of the sloppiness. There is no next time and I will be replacing my rear tyres elsewhere and certainly not coming back for any servicing.",0

Great Shelford Tree,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Great%20Shelford%20Tree&query_place_id=ChIJg7z9zpoR2jERbTVdk9OZ9Uk,5.0,,,"Nestled in the cozy cul-de-sac on Shelford Road, the Great Shelford Tree is more than just a solitary tree; it’s an enchanting landmark and a celebrated tourist attraction that holds the power to transform your perspective and inspire profound reflection. This hidden gem, while seemingly simple, is a breathtaking reminder of nature’s beauty and resilience, standing tall against the backdrop of suburban life.
 
 As you approach, the ambiance shifts. The gentle rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of birds create a serene soundtrack that invites you to pause and breathe deeply. The tree, with its sprawling branches and lush green canopy, forms a natural cathedral, beckoning visitors to experience its tranquility. I vividly remember my first visit on a sunny afternoon; the light filtered through the leaves, casting intricate patterns on the ground, making it feel almost magical.
 
 What truly sets the Great Shelford Tree apart is its history. Local lore suggests that this tree has stood for over a century, witnessing the ebb and flow of life around it. Generations of families have gathered beneath its branches for picnics, storytelling, and even proposals. I spoke to a local elder who fondly recounted how, as a child, he would climb its sturdy limbs, feeling like a king surveying his kingdom. It’s clear this tree has served as a silent witness to countless life events, each one adding to its mystique.
 
 Visitors often come not just for the beauty, but for the personal connections they forge with this magnificent tree. I’ve seen people leave behind tokens—a painted rock, a love note, or a small memento—each representing a moment of joy or a wish for the future. On my second visit, I joined a group of artists for a plein air painting session. The atmosphere was electric, filled with laughter and creativity as we each attempted to capture the tree’s essence. As I painted, I felt a connection to those who had come before me, each brushstroke a tribute to the tree’s enduring legacy.
 
 The Great Shelford Tree also serves as a hub for the community. Throughout the year, various events take place around this majestic tree—seasonal festivals, quaint gatherings, and meditation sessions. The camaraderie is palpable as friends connect over their love for this natural wonder.
 
 One of the most poignant aspects of the Great Shelford Tree is its capacity for reflection. Standing beneath its vast canopy, I often contemplate my life journey. In a world that feels overwhelming, this tree offers grounding and peace. It has become a personal sanctuary where I can escape the hustle and bustle of daily life.
 
 For those seeking inspiration, solace, or a simple moment of connection with nature, the Great Shelford Tree is an essential stop. It’s not just a tourist attraction; it’s a life-changing experience that encourages you to slow down, appreciate the beauty around you, and forge connections—with both nature and those around you.
 
 If you find yourself in the vicinity, I urge you to pay a visit. Bring a journal, a sketchbook, or simply your thoughts. You may leave with a renewed sense of purpose or just a smile, knowing you’ve encountered something truly special. The Great Shelford Tree isn’t just a tree; it’s a monument to life itself, waiting to share its wisdom with anyone willing to listen.",0

 Although the team is pretty new, and the mechanics are young. Their expertise is far beyond their age. Ah Kuan has a very high standard of work, and is able to find the root cause of issues very easily. When an engine rebuild is done, he does a stand-by bed standard of placing parts so that nothing is missed out. The other 2 mechanics are also attentive to details, and will clarify any issues you report.
 
 Being my 4th visit so far, they have saved me quite alot of money by finding out the actual real root cause, instead of just making you replace everything like some workshops do....
 
 Solutions provided are well thought out and they are linked up with the Malaysia branches so parts can be easily sourced even for old cars. Reasonable pricing, service is unrivalled

Out of the three visits I have made, I’ve only managed to dine in once despite checking the opening hours prior to the journey over. Found out that this is due to the staff’s break time being unaccounted for within the operational hours listed on their establishment (or Google Maps especially for the first visit - attached picture from first visit on a Saturday, 8/6/24 12PM).
 
 Made my way down with a friend to this place for the swing seats and cozy environment, only to be met by an unforeseen closure of an hour. When asked if we could sit and wait inside until then (as the surrounding area doesn’t have much to do and mosquitoes were flying around), we were turned away as well. I would be understanding if the break was listed like how Korean restaurants choose to take time off in the afternoon, but it’s absolutely disappointing to be turned away for something that is not accounted for within their operating hours stated. Wound up going to a different place instead.
 
 Edit: did not check Google Maps for third visit, but I did ask staff about operational hours during my second visit + checked iG before third visit in case there were any closures not announced on Maps. I’m not sure when the break time was added into Google Maps, but don’t recall it being there during my second visit (earlier this year).",0

 Saw LiteMobile on TikTok FYP for a burn mark on my LCD screen. Went to their branch, got the repair with a ""3-month warranty."" I pointed out a scratch immediately, but they said it was just dirt! Now there's a bright white spot that wasn't there before! The manufacturer is just rabak!
 
 Their customer service (via WhatsApp) is APPALLING. Instant replies from another's phone pretending to be a new customer, but ""bohlayan"" when I tried to claim my warranty. After ranting to ""Desmond"" on WhatsApp, he offered a refund AND a new LCD. I refused because their rabak customer service made me lose all trust. They suddenly claimed my phone had a bloated battery and could damage the screen, wanting to ""check"" it. Sketchy!
 
 LiteMobile needs to prioritize warranty claims and acknowledge issues instead of dismissing them. First and last time customer here. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else!

Roy from Zenith Auotmotive appeared to be “Mr Nice Guy” but he is actually a wolf under a sheep skin. Zenith Automotive is managed by Roy, his wife, his son and daughters. I’ve been repairing my car at zenith for more than 5 years. My whole family too as we are all staying nearby. He was introduced to us by our Cycle&Carriage salesperson Han Ai Lin. At first, he appeared to be very nice and honest. But after a few repairs, I felt that something was off. Everytime we repair a problem, a new problem will arise. At first I thought it was pure coincidence but this not only happened to me all the time, but also my dad’s, my mum’s and my sis’s car. The last I remembered was I repaired my aircon at Zenith, 1-2 days after car collection, my engine starts to make weird sounds. His charges seemed to be reasonable like repair for the aircon $800 but in the end I always have to add on another few thousands. This didn’t happen once, it happened many times. This time, I went to repair my new car as my husband has met a small accident. He repaired my bumper for few hundred dollars. He said he repaired the headlamp mounting too. After awhile, our headlights starts to turn misty and the headlights was damaged due to the mist. We went back to Cycle & Carriage and they mentioned that it was because Zenith did not repair it properly, he simply use a glue to repair the mounting, resulting the headlights to have mist and damage it. I have asked a few more workshops and they said the same thing. So his style is to charge a reasonable amount and so you have more new problems and go back and pay more money for the repair. I’ve asked a few workshop friends and realised that he is well-known to be dishonest in the industry. Please do not be fooled by them anymore!!!",0

I happened to see this button and requested to do this. Owner was not open to feedback and did not listen. His only response he kept saying was along the lines of if you are so smart, complain to Lazada and you are not happy with the service then don’t come here when he actually did not even take the time to understand the what the issue was. He also instituted a useless step in the SOP where you have to press a button on some pillar before coming to the counter when pressing the button doesn’t even generate a queue number or result in anything different after pressing the button.
 
 Good luck getting any help or support from this store as they don’t adopt customer centric values. Will never buy anything from here again.",0

I saw her packed them individually in bags of 2 slices so I didn’t check the bag after I reached home and immediately stored in the freezer. Three days later, I removed them from the freezer and realised that she had bags with 2 slices and there is one big bag with a harden chunk of 4 thick slices of salmon which was so hardened that I had to let it thaw under running water.

 We visited SkyHelix Sentosa in the morning, hoping for something fun or unique, but left feeling a bit underwhelmed.
 
 The experience involves sitting in a parachute-like open-air gondola that slowly ascends into the sky and gently rotates to offer a 360° view of Sentosa. It lasts about 10-15 minutes. During that time, an instructor gives a short introduction and tries to entertain the group, which was nice, but there’s only so much you can do in that span, especially when the ride itself is very passive.
 
 This is not a ride or anything adventurous. There’s no adrenaline rush, no surprises, just a slow ascent, a calm view, and a slow descent. The view in the morning was okay, but not particularly spectacular. Maybe a sunset or night session would be better for photography or ambiance.
 
 That said, this attraction is suitable for people who aren’t into adventure or thrill rides and are just looking for a mild, scenic experience. It's peaceful and easy, making it ideal for families with young kids or older folks who want a simple, elevated view of the island.
 
 Overall, it’s a decent, short activity, but if you're someone looking for excitement, SkyHelix probably won't deliver that.",0

 I bought a camera here that will be used as a gift. No one was around to help, so I went to the cashier area and asked someone to sell the item to me. I specifically asked if the item I will be buying can be returned as I don't want to open the box since it will be a gift I will give on my overseas trip. The guy who helped me said it could be returned after 14 days. I counted my overseas trip days, and if ever there is a defect, I can still return it after my trip.
 
 Armed with this info, I immediately paid for the item. When I double-checked with the cashier about the return policy, much to my surprise, he said the item only has a 1 week return policy. I argued that they falsely provided sales terms and misled me into buying the item. As a compromise, I asked if they could test it instead, though I am hesitant since I want the box sealed when I give my gift - but to add to the incompetence so far, they said they don't have a dedicated salesperson who can test it.
 
 Since they have no solutions for me and we just stared at each other for minutes with no one offering even a simple apology, much less a work around the issue, I just opted to refund the item.
 
 When the person who will process my refund came and asked the guy if I would need a refund, the guy even had the gall to tell her I changed my mind. I didn't let it pass since they are the one who changed the terms of sale right there, not me. Stores usually get sued and fined for this kind of misleading sales, but the staff are not even bothered by the mistake and incompetence they just displayed. In any other setup, this kind of attitude leads to suspension or even dismissal, but I guess Courts Orchard management is satisfied with being mediocre and incompetent.",0

However, I must say the staff service does get a 5-star rating for me as coming in at 1 am the staff member was SUPER helpful, offering me even some food after travelling late night, very nice service. ||||The dormitory rooms were in a very old style layout and design, it looked more run down to me than old-style but this is more just personal preference, the beds and bunks are a bit hard but for a budget hostel more than fine enough. The showers are a bit weirdly designed in dorms but otherwise, I had no problems staying here with a quick layover personally.",0

The location is good, just a few minutes walk from Bugis MRT station, and there are many restaurants nearby.However, I give it one star out of five. I don't know about the women's room, but there is only one water tap (sink) for the men's room for over 50 people. There are only four toilets and showers, two separate ones and two in each room. This doesn't seem to violate Singapore law, but it clearly shows the owner's attitude towards his guests. In the morning, you often have to fight with other people over the sink, and it's normal to wait 5-10 minutes. It's not cleaned and dirty.There are also numerous shoes and slippers left in a mess at the entrance, including disposable slippers that have been thrown away. Footwear is not permitted inside the building, but the floors are dirty and indoor beach sandals are a must.There is a refrigerator, but it is not organized at all, and there is rotten food left there, giving off a foul odor, so new guests should assume that it is practically unusable. The price is close to the lowest in the area, so the clientele is extremely poor. The room is small, and there are many suitcases at the entrance, so the door sometimes cannot be opened. There is no space to pack luggage inside the room.",0

Then the screen that shows the price was even blocked by so many items, I can't even check my price before paying!
 
 What's worse is that when I paid a $50 bill for an $8+ items, the Indian lady go on and say ""Next time cannot do this, we just opened in the morning not enough bills"", but she can proceed to give me the change, where is not enough bills? I told her this was the only cash I have and she ask me to do Paywave next time, which I also told her that I don't have it at that moment. She proceed to repeat saying I can't do this next time. I just told her I'm not coming anymore next time. Hey, what nonsense is this? You need to have so many rules for your purchasing customers? So many rules for generating one simple receipt, now pay money also need so many rules. You sure its your rules or the 7-eleven rules?!

 During a recent visit, the highlight was a plate of Hokkien Mee, which retained the wok hei aroma and balanced seafood richness that fans of the original centre would recognize. The noodles were well-braised, with a generous mix of prawns and squid, and came with a sambal that was both smoky and sharp. Despite the change in location, the quality and character of the dish remain impressively intact.
 
 For dessert, the Ice Kachang offered a refreshing counterpoint. It came tall and finely shaved, with a classic mix of red beans, attap seeds, jelly, and sweet corn, topped with syrup that didn’t overwhelm. The texture and taste were reminiscent of hawker desserts from an earlier era — unpretentious and satisfying.
 
 While the market can feel stuffy, especially during lunchtime, this is an understandable trade-off given its temporary structure and heavy foot traffic. Ventilation fans are in place, but visitors might prefer to come earlier in the day or later in the afternoon for a more comfortable experience.
 
 Despite the spatial limitations, the market maintains a familiar charm. Seating is reasonably ample, the place is kept clean, and stallholders continue to serve food with the same energy and pride as before. For those who frequented the old Bukit Timah Market, the new setup offers continuity — not just in taste, but in spirit.
 
 For anyone looking to revisit old favourites or explore enduring hawker craft, the Jalan Seh Chuan site is well worth the trip.",0

 If there were an award for disappointment, Samsung would win hands down. I trusted a globally renowned brand, paid a premium, and ended up with dead pixels on my screen.

 But wait, it gets worse.
 
 When I reached out to Samsung Singapore’s customer care, hoping for a solution, I was met with a level of indifference that was honestly insulting. Instead of helping, they had the audacity to say:
 “We don’t know how you handled the phone.”
 Seriously? That’s your response? Not only are your devices flawed, but now it’s the customer’s fault for expecting them to work?
 
 I’m baffled. A flagship product with a screen issue and a support team that gaslights the user. This isn’t just bad service — it’s pathetic. For a company that spends millions on marketing and brand image, your actual product quality and support are a disgrace.

 1. What do you mean I order a pot of tea and can’t share it because you’re refusing to give me an extra cup??? I literally ordered a POT, I genuinely believe it’s big enough to share. LOL
 For the same price you can go to literal ATLAS Bar instead of this place and receive actual service.
 
 2. We order 9$ tea and end up with 11.90$ bill? 3 dollars of service charge FOR WHAT? for you not giving me an extra cup of tea?!
 
 3. No alternative milk options. The person that I was with literally has lactose intolerance. What is he supposed to do with this cafe not having any options for him? Like, this is not uncommon, I think all the modern F&B business should have variety of options.",0

The check-in process was a headache, with gaps in the instructions. Despite reaching out to customer service for help, I still ended up having to figure it out mostly on my own and it took way too long. Self-check-in isn't a new concept, but the way it's handled here is disjointed and leaves a lot to be desired.
 
 Finding the place is next to impossible, and the instructions didn't give the actual location. Like others, I had to rely on reviews to track it down. (PS: If you're struggling to find the entrance, look for a lift inside an unmarked entrance at the back of an alley at a different address — it's at number 13, not 11...)
 
 Once inside, the cleanliness wasn't up to par and trash was scattered around. There's a loud club in the same building that shakes the floor all night. At that point, I decided to cut my losses and found another place to stay.
 
 I appreciated that the staff responded to my concerns by email and we had a polite dialogue, but they refused to provide a refund for future nights I wasn't going to stay. It would have been nice to see more flexibility given the circumstances.
 
 Overall, the experience here wasn't good, and they were content to keep my money despite providing a poor experience. I'd explore other options in the area next time.

 Location: 3/5
 Cleanliness: 4/5
 Service Attitude: 5/5
 Value for Money: 5/5
 
 I managed to book this hotel at a super affordable promotional rate! To my surprise, the price included a private bathroom — and even room cleaning service, which was unexpected! What impressed me the most was the front desk staff’s service — they were extremely polite and greeted us with a cheerful “Good morning” every day as we left the hotel.
 
 There’s also a bar in the hotel, perfect for relaxing after a long day out. Plus, the hotel provides a public drinking water dispenser — I really appreciated that!
 
 The only downside is that it takes about a 10-minute walk to the nearest MRT station. However, for those who take the bus, the bus stop is very close by. The room isn’t particularly big, but for RM200 a night, I dare you to compare — you won’t easily find another hotel offering a private bathroom and a double bed at this price.

Noodles are al dente and the fish balls are nice. The lor mee is similarly excellent. Can’t say the same about the prawn noodle shop though. It sells prawn noodles, pork rib noodles, wonton noodles, and some combination of chicken and charsiew rice. The noodles are pedestrian and the meats are not very good. The pork rib noodle is tasty but that’s the noodle. The meat itself is not very tasty and not very soft. Ditto the charsiew. Also very strange for pork rib noodles to be served on a plate. It’s just weird. I’d avoid this stall like the plague the next time. I see a very enticing fish porridge soup. Oh and I like the soya bean stall. There are others but not all are open even on a Saturday (or because it is a Saturday… been 3 Saturdays). If visiting, please avoid parking there for Saturday lunch.

Butternut Tree Hotel,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Butternut%20Tree%20Hotel&query_place_id=ChIJoyVoLcgZ2jERApQWfKAj0OE,2.0,,,"This was our second time staying at Butternut, and we didn’t even consider looking at other hotels because our first stay left such a positive impression. Most of the staff were still as warm, friendly, and welcoming as we remembered, and we truly appreciated that. However, this recent stay felt quite different from our first.
 
 Previously, we booked the L Room with Queen Bed and Window (12 m²/129 ft²), which felt spacious and comfortable. We had two large suitcases, two small ones, and two personal bags--and we could easily lay both large suitcases open on the floor with slight room to move around. This time, we chose the L Room with Skylight Window, which is also listed as 12 m²/129 ft² on Agoda. However, the layout felt SIGNIFICANTLY more cramped than expected. I cannot stress SIGNIFICANTLY enough. We could only open one suitcase at a time, and with limited floor space, it was difficult to move around...especially after shopping or with larger luggage. The room appeared more spacious in the photos, but in person, it felt closer in size to an M or even an S room. Although the listed area is the same as our previous room, the difference in usable space was quite noticeable, and honestly, it was our biggest letdown during this stay.
 
 We also noticed that some of the amenities listed for our room like slippers, a desk, a telephone, and an in-room or laptop safe were not available. My partner kindly asked the front desk for slippers, but we were told they were unavailable. We're not sure if this was a temporary situation or if these items are no longer part of the standard setup.
 
 Another thing to keep in mind is that there’s no lift access to the 4th floor. You have to take the stairs. This might be important to consider for guests with heavy or bulky luggage and might get a room at the 4th floor. Also, the air conditioning took quite some time (around two hours) to cool the room, which was a bit surprising given its compact size.
 
 We do hope the property stays true to what is described and promised in their listing in the future. We were honestly disappointed by the discrepancies, especially after having such a great first stay last 2023. While we did encounter one staff member who seemed a bit unfriendly, we truly appreciate the rest of the team who were consistently kind, accommodating, and approachable throughout our stay. Their warm hospitality is one of the reasons we might still consider staying at Butternut again...along with its convenient location near Maxwell Food Centre, Maxwell MRT, and Chinatown Complex.",0

 My personal experience is that this place feels very iffy because unlike the other TCMs I’ve been to, this one feels very “business oriented”. Went in for a consultation for discomfort in stomach: $40 Consultation, $113 for 1 week medication. Total $153!
 Needless to say I was gobsmacked when I saw the bill.
 
 Also, doctor was pushing for acupuncture right off the bat. Luckily I read some reviews beforehand saying they will try to push services onto you so I declined.

 It was close to midnight, and with nowhere else to go, I asked if the cab fare could be reimbursed given the sudden change. Instead, I was met with excuses — that she was new, crossed in and out of JB, had to pay rent, etc. She even went on to say Singaporeans are “calculative,” I told her it's not a matter of being a Singaporean but about professionalism, she insisted that she's right and that she never faced this when working in JB.

CompAsia Singapore,https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=CompAsia%20Singapore&query_place_id=ChIJuXX0QdEb2jERszBT2Jh2Lcs,1.0,,,"Utterly disappointed me for the 3rd time.
 
 I have no choice but to deal with CompAsia because official Samsung engages with CompAsia for their trade-in services. What you see in the screenshot is what happened this year (August 2025), the driver failed to turn up after we have scheduled a pick up of my old phone on the specified date with the reason being ""Car Broke Down"". The date was arranged almost a month prior. This wasn't a last minute arrangement.
 
 But this wasn't the first time this occured. In the past (2023), when I also traded-in my old phone for a new phone with Samsung, they also used CompAsia for the trade-in service and CompAsia also failed to show up the 1st time with the reason also being ""Car Broke Down"". We rescheduled to another date then to my shock, they told me they couldn't come again. After I got so mad at them they finally show up on the 3rd reschedule.
 
 So what you see in the screenshot, is what just happened a few days ago (August 2025). Which means this is the 3rd time they failed to show up with the same reason, ""Car Broke Down"". How bad is the condition of their cars that it keeps breaking down? Everytime CompAsia has to pick up my old phone for trade -in they just couldn't make it. CompAsia doesn't understand that people had to find time and make effort to be at home and wait for them. I took a day off to be home and I'm not being paid for the day I'm not working.
 
 Now they are telling me to reschedule and I have to risk another day of not being paid and them not showing up. They don't do pick-ups on weekends by the way. And they do this to me 3 times. Making the same mistake 3 times just seems intentional.
 
 I don't understand why Samsung is working with them. Samsung definitely needs to know about this especially if I am not the only one experiencing this.
 
 UPDATE : THEY DISAPPOINTED ME THE 4TH TIME
 I've added additional screenshots with numbered sequence so everyone can look at the pictures in order.
 
 1. They said to reschedule to Aug 11th, but I told them I won't be free for at least 2 weeks after they failed to show up on Aug 8th when I was ready to handover the device.
 
 2. They still showed up Aug 11th when I wasn't home. Then tried to blame me for not being home and sent me proof of them being outside my door. But I already told them I won't be home on Aug 11th. They even acknowledged it in email that they are aware I won't be home.

 I also like that each floor (including the lobby / reception area) has large ""public spaces"" with sofas 🛋️, chairs and coffee tables to lounge at, chill out and grab a snack. That's quite unusual.
 
 You do get the feeling that with some investment, this could be a great little boutique hotel in the Bengkong Laut / Golden City area. The other two hotels (Golden Bay and Golden View) are also pretty old, tired and in desperate need of renovation. Golden View Hotel is also MASSIVELY overpriced.
 
 I'd really like to see this hotel be renovated. The area needs more, good, accommodation because there's a lot to see and do in the area - beaches, beach clubs, historic mosque (Masjid Cheng Hoo), many fantastic eateries, watersports, Wake Park, theme parks, carousel 🎠, 🎡 wheel, food and drink stalls, miniature houses open museum, go kart 🏎️ track etc etc etc.

 Kamarnya sangat tua dan usang. TAPI staf, layanan, dan lokasinya luar biasa. Salut untuk Alif dan Deena. Layanan mereka hangat, ramah, dan profesional. Layanannya lebih baik daripada kebanyakan hotel bintang 4.
 
 Saya juga suka bahwa setiap lantai (termasuk lobi/area resepsionis) memiliki ""ruang publik"" yang luas dengan sofa 🛋️, kursi, dan meja kopi untuk bersantai, bersantai, dan menikmati camilan. Hal yang cukup unik.
 
 Anda mungkin merasa bahwa dengan sedikit investasi, ini bisa menjadi hotel butik kecil yang bagus di area Bengkong Laut/Golden City. Dua hotel lainnya (Golden Bay dan Golden View) juga cukup tua, usang, dan sangat membutuhkan renovasi. Golden View Hotel juga SANGAT mahal.
 
 Saya sangat ingin melihat hotel ini direnovasi. Daerah ini butuh lebih banyak akomodasi yang bagus, karena ada banyak hal yang bisa dilihat dan dilakukan di daerah tersebut - pantai, klub pantai, masjid bersejarah (Masjid Cheng Hoo), banyak tempat makan yang fantastis, olahraga air, Wake Park, taman hiburan, komidi putar 🎠, bianglala 🎡, kios makanan dan minuman, rumah miniatur museum terbuka, lintasan go kart 🏎️, dll.",0

 Was wrongly advised by sales staff regarding the SG60 discounts ($120 off instead of $60) and use of climate vouchers for a dryer (cannot be used) only at the point of purchase. Decided to proceed with buying the Samsung dryer.
 
 After purchase, did not receive any confirmation of notification of delivery of actual date, only a call 10 mins before delivery. Delivery window was 10am to 2pm, and ended up staying home for 3 hours (10am to 1pm) before getting a call that the delivery was coming. Sales staff also was hard to contact regarding delivery (2 to 3h wait, only responded after calling). Understand it was his off day, but Courts should have a staff to cover for him since it still involved deliveries, or have a more contactable number.
 
 Sales staff also wrongly scheduled the Samsung delivery agent, so ended up the agent only came 1 day after the dryer was delivered. Asked for a specific time for the agent to come (3pm) to make up for the mistake but ended up with delaying my delivery window (originally 2 to 6pm) to 3 to 7pm. As of 545pm, the agent is still not here. (Edit: Agent ended up being late, and I was forced to take cab to my appointment)
 
 This is one of my worst sales service to date, from pre to post sales. The only good things about this whole process was the advice given on the right dryer to buy (pre sales) and the free delivery given in an attempt to recover from the mistake in the supposed discount.

 Unfortunately, while the food was decent, the service left much to be desired. It appeared that only one service staff was managing the floor, which resulted in a long wait for drinks and multiple reminders needed for cutlery, condiments, and basic requests.

 I was attended to by Jack who was very professional and courteous. He managed to diagnose the problem in a couple of minutes as a blown motherboard fuse and gave me a reasonable and transparent quotation to fix the problem.
 
 3 days later, my iPhone is working as good as a brand new phone again! Jack was also very gracious to add in a free screen protector replacement for me as he had to remove the old one while disassembling my phone. The repair also came with a 3 month warranty. Overall, a 5 star service and I would recommend coming here for phone repair services. Keep up the good work!",0

 Entry & Pricing
 Upon arrival, we were offered two options: $60 standard entry or $80 with bar coupons. We opted for the latter, assuming it would provide better value – a decision we quickly regretted. The coupon system felt like a marketing gimmick rather than genuine added value.
 
 Atmosphere & Crowd
 The venue was surprisingly sparse, with fewer than 30 patrons despite the modest space. Even accounting for the club's compact size, the atmosphere felt lifeless and lacking the energy you'd expect from a proper nightlife venue. The sparse crowd made the evening feel more awkward than intimate.
 
 Interior & Cleanliness
 The bar area desperately needs renovation – the aesthetic can only be described as dated and uninspiring, reminiscent of an old Eastern Bloc establishment. More concerning was the cleanliness standard: our table left black residue on contact, suggesting poor maintenance and hygiene practices. This immediately raised red flags about the venue's upkeep.
 
 Facilities
 The restroom facilities were particularly disappointing – cramped, unclean, and genuinely uncomfortable to use. For a venue charging premium entry prices, basic cleanliness should be non-negotiable.
 Redeeming Features
 The only highlight was the outdoor terrace area, which provided a brief respite from the indoor environment and served as a decent smoking area.
 
 Verdict
 After less than an hour, our group decided to cut our losses and leave. For $80 per person, there are numerous superior venues in Singapore that offer better atmosphere, cleanliness, and overall experience. Tuff Club needs significant improvements in maintenance, crowd management, and basic hygiene standards before it can compete with the city's established nightlife scene.
 Would I return? Definitely not.
 Would I recommend? Only if you're specifically looking for a cautionary tale about Singapore's nightlife scene.",0

Doctors are efficient. I conveyed my feedback to the anchor Dr Aamir. He promised to speak to the receptionists so hope situation will improve in the future.
 Receptionists have poor understanding of workflow, gave wrong information and still talked down on patients and arrogant.
 1. Enquired on COVID vaccine and RSV vaccine. COVID vaccine needs to register on MOH webpage but NOT the clinic webpage (as advised to scan QR code of clinic at the counter). Only acknowledged this mistake after I offered twice to show them my phone.Told me no RSV vaccine available when it’s shown on website with price. Clearly they don’t even know what vaccine services are provided at the clinic and are too lazy to even look up upon request.
 2. Vaccine record was missed by the first doctor to upload to healthHUB. Could be easily corrected by checking with the doctor. However receptionists first dismissed my request and told me to check with MOH??! Only upon insisting did they register me to clarify with the doctor who admitted it was a missed upload and amended on the spot.
 3. Maid health check up records. We told the receptionists that we need a copy and the receptionists said they’d call us back in about 1 week to collect result. No phone call or follow up. Had to walk in to get result again. Told today that the routine practice is to just upload result to MOM as most customers don’t want a copy?
 All mistakes could have been cordially resolved but the receptionists talking down on patients simply made the experience truly unpleasant.",0

 Basically some part of the chronic stiffness I had in my left shoulder and upper back was taken care of. Not that it's totally gone (can't expect that from just two sessions...), but I'd say it was a structural / fundamental kind of change, not just dealing with the surface / symptom level. I've had spine issues for many years and also surgery, and have seen a number of physiotherapists, chiropractors, get massages weekly etc. etc., and I'd say I've not had therapy that's had such a significant change before.

 On the other hand, masseur (didn’t ask her name) was really good. Ask about room temperature and her pressure throughout the session. Focused on the areas I was tight with. Several times during the session nearly dozed off even though the massage pressure was firm. At the end, even offered a hot drink.
 
 Overall ambience was good. Old wooden buildings have more charm but wooden furniture will creak with food steps on the wooden floor as well as opening/closing doors. Maybe I was the only one but it was quiet and calm I.e. relaxing.

 Gus was incredibly accommodating—he allowed the kids (ages 4 and up) to have their own space at the loft, where we held the balloon sculpting and party games. This gave them plenty of room to have fun with minimal restrictions, which we really appreciated.
 
 The food received great feedback from our guests, and everything was served in a timely manner. Special thanks to Bob and Junear as well, who helped a lot with coordination before and during the event.

Zenith told us to change front shock absorber and battery. We paid $1,110 for the change. After taking the car back the noise on the tyre was still not resolved, we brought it in and he said he lubricated it so should be ok. But it was not. We brought the car back for the third time and asked to pay another $480 to change something else. We negotiated the price and still paid. 1 month later, the notification on dashboard for battery discharge came up AGAIN. We brought it back in and asked to pay another $200 and they provided the battery life and diagnostics showing another problem. We paid but no idea whether the problem is actually fixed or not.. When I asked him about the battery life and diagnostics on the first visit when we were advised to change the new battery, they gave me a lecture about mutual trust and did not show it (lol). So both our problems when we first brought the car in were not fixed in first visit and we kept going back to check and top up later.

 It was worth the money. Not only were they friendly and helpful when I was in doubt, the boss recommended what work was needed to be done for my car. There were many parts that needed to be changed that the previous workshops didn't tell me to.

This is hands down one of the most frustrating and painful service experiences I’ve had. I brought in a Samsung device for what should have been a straightforward power button repair. I was first quoted around $200, then later received a text saying that the cost had increased to over $400—with no proper explanation.
 
 When I finally received a call, I was told the technician had now found the touchscreen to be “faulty.” How convenient—this issue only appeared after they disassembled the device. I was then told they couldn’t perform a partial repair just for the power button, so I’d have to pay for the screen as well.
 
 Over the phone, I specifically asked multiple times if my device would be returned in the same condition if I didn’t proceed and the person acknowledged that it would, and I made my expectations very clear. Even before sending it in, I made this expectation known—but now, of course, no one will admit to it.
 
 When I didn’t proceed with the repair and came to collect my device, I checked and had to ask them to charge and demonstrate it—and that’s when it was revealed the screen wasn’t even showing the charging indicator anymore.
 
 Here’s the worst part—when they tried to justify it, they told me that fixing the button would “unavoidably” damage the touchscreen, meaning I’d be forced to pay for both. If that was the case, WHY wasn’t it disclosed upfront? Why quote one thing, then hold my device hostage with unexpected, unexplained charges?
 
 Zero transparency. No accountability. The responses felt scripted, and the way things were handled left me, the customer, feeling like I was somehow at fault for not asking the “right” questions—when I had, multiple times. Save yourself the trouble. Don’t send your device here unless you’re ready to be overcharged, misled, and left angry and helpless.",0

 最后要吐槽办理入住！！！机器刷护照自助入住，下午3点以后才能操作——相当于3点前我只能拿着行李在门口干等着，不能进屋不能寄存行李，非常的不方便！！！门口也没人接待，最后是其他房客出门，打开门才进的屋。",0

 深夜3時まで外は音楽がガンガン(日曜の夜でさえ)、人のしゃべっている内容まで聞こえる、工事音やバイクのエンジン音のうるささは、まるで外で布団を敷いて寝ているかのようなレベルです。
 
 また、3日間の滞在中、タオルはリクエストすれば新しいものがもらえますが、夜になるとスタッフが不在になるので、朝一に依頼することをおすすめします。
 
 ホテル自体や立地を考えるとシンガポールの中ではコスパがいい方なのだと思いますが、耳栓や完全防音のヘッドホンをしなければ本当に寝れません。おかげでこの3日間寝不足になりました。もし次泊まるとしたら窓無しの部屋を選びます。こんなにもうるさいのであれば、そもそも窓がない部屋の方がマシな気がします。ただ、寝不足になるくらいなら追加でお金を払ってでも、部屋の中にいると思えるホテルに泊まります。",0

 目前為止待過性價比最高的Hostel.原因如下:
 1. 價格真的很便宜
 2. 床鋪很乾淨,連續住兩天 可以發現他們都有換洗枕頭套及被單.
 3. 服務人員很親切,尤其是佩穎,連續兩天帶我去體驗新加坡生活,儘管我之後搬到其他青年旅舍.
 4. 地點位置佳,離小印度及阿拉伯街都很近.雖然離地鐵站有10分鐘的距離.
 
 整體來說,在房間裡面有自己的空間(類似膠囊房),公共客廳又很有家庭的感覺.大家會在那邊看電視聊天.
 
 非常推薦 ,值得一住
