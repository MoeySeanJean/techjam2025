I work for them Barre Vt Location,1
Here in Barre for a 5 day conference. Book it at location because it was cheap to rent a room.,1
They are so polite and have consideration for their customers. They greet you when you come in and thank you feel comfortable. If you don't want your nails stick and you want to be able to scratch or use your nails at all go to TNT they don't make the nails thick and make them thin enough so you can feel things with them.,1
"We really appreciate your business and wanted to welcome you to t&t Nails Spa! We'll try our best to serve you, and we hope you enjoy your nails.
We look forward to your continued business.",1
I would not go anywhere else. Perhaps it's because there was a time I worked there for several years or perhaps it's just because a few of them I call friend. This is a company that has what you need when you need it if you don't have water they're the ones to call.,1
Never been there.,1
They have tires,1
"I bought my second bike from Vintage Steele and got a fun ride, helpful and knowledgeable bike mechanics, and great friends in Josh and Chris! I have and will continue to recommend folks to Vintage Steele, especially lady riders. Josh and Chris are welcoming and not condescending to women who are new or experienced bike owners.",1
My bike was quickly and expertly repaired here for a great price by genuinely friendly and welcoming staff.  Their customization work being done on other projects in the garage was jawdroppingly inspiring.  Do yourself a favor and visit Vintage Steele for any bike needs.,1

"The change from whole body healing to warehouse treatment for those with mental health issues has led to a drastic decline in the services the Retreat provides.
Huge disconnect from the people who run the place and the people who care directly for the patients.
The administration under the new CEO is shameful at best.
The Retreat needs to go back to following the Mission Statement inspired by Anna Marsh.",1
Beautiful snowflakes ready for winter..,1

Busy place looking for workers!,1
keep me on the mailing list than you,1
I called to get the records for a dog I rehomed and the lady was very nice. I do not personally take my animals there because I haven't heard very many good things about them.,1

The best pipe shop in town. Lowest prices. Biggest variety. Friendlest people.,1
Love this place!!! Get all my glass here,1
Whip-its. Adult toys. Not just a smoke shop. It's upstairs.,1
This place closes at 615pm? Maybe you should shut down the laundry service at 615pm but leave the place open so the people not using the service can still access the machines. That is what most other laundomats do. This is the only place in saint albans to do laundry in public. I suppose I could go down to the creek and do it the old fashioned way.,1
Gotta get back on track,1
Great plays,1
Hockey hockey hockey,1
Good weekly deals. Fun short 9 hole course.,1
I'm pretty sure it not real meat,1
A great place to purchase art from local Vermont artists. We purchase something  almost every time we visit.,1
"This is my second vehicle purchase with Twin State Ford and I couldn't be happier.  Byron Moore, Dan Brick and Pete Deschamps made great efforts to locate a new vehicle with my specific needs, get my ads ins transferred to the new vehicle and have made this an absolutely pain free experience.  As always I will refer folks to this dedicated dealership  who consistently go above and beyond.",1
This dealership needs to get there head on straight,1
Improper explanation of services addition of extra services that weren't asked for,1
Over priced,1
I would drive 2 hours one way to get a pedicure at Phinne Nail Salon!,1
I have never had the pleasure of going there. I have 2 guineas which I'm sure isnt on there list of pets lol. But as you can imagine they are very difficult to clip there nails. Everytime I call there for advice they always offer to try and clip them. I schedule an appointment. Always cancel it for one reason or another. But they are always willing to help and try!,1

Always a great place to find steel and big truck parts plus the service is always great,1
"Its quick and convenient, most of the time tasty. I'd stay away from end of night orders.",1
"If you like boondock camping and are prepared for it, this is a very, very nice park. We pull a 24' Travel Trailer and although we cold get in and out, it was tight. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just something to be ready for.
Like most of the VT State parks, the Ranger staff was friendly and helpful.
The dumping station was a little bit weird, but everything worked well, so it's all good.",1
Trusting,1
"Nice place with nice, friendly people",1
Clean efficient machines in various sizes.,1
Great food and pleasant people but a little bit on the pricey side,1
"Great hardware store overall, especially with their much needed expanded lumber yard. My only complaint is if you have to special order anything is a huge hassle. Nobody seams to know what to do even to get a price quote.",1
"Always good food , my favorite Chinese takeout",1
just don't care for it is bland n not tasty,1
"Nice store with plenty of pool supplies, helpful staff and friendly environment. Will be back for my swimming pool supplies and needs.",1

These women are great! They do a wonderful job and are very kind. I am sensitive to the strong smells of a nail salon and this salon does not have that problem!,1
A nice place to get a tattoo.....,1
"I designed a custom diamond and platinum engagement ring with the assistance of Caitlin Silber and I couldn't have asked for more! Caitlin was extremely knowledgeable of the custom design process and made it an easy and fun experience. She took my ideas, sketched them out and then generated a 3-D version of the ring for me to view before finalizing. My fiancee loves the ring and so do I. All in all, I would recommend Caitlin & Perrywinkle's to friends and family.",1
Great little store so much fun,1
"Great service and prices.
Repaired a chip in the windshield quickly and at a fair price without an appointment.  Have had them replace two windshields and they do quality work.",1
"The professionals at Aspen Dental were warm and welcoming for my procedure. Dr. Caric, Office Manager Stephanie, Dental Assistant Catherine, and Receptionist Erika ensured that all my needs were met. Costs were up front and all details of my procedure and my overall dental plan were handled professionally. I am very happy with the level of service and would recommend them to anyone looking for a new dental office.",1
Beautiful views and clean,1
Love this place always clean and great staff. The therapy works great. Amazing place!,1
"Great cut, great conversation, great price. What else could you ask for?",1
Awesome barbor!!,1
"I recently upgraded to a 30 HP compact tractor for residential use.  I had tested and considered many competing options including Massey, Mahindra and John Deere.  After initially ruling out Kubota due to price point, I had the opportunity to meet with Matthew LaRose from Champlain Valley Equipment.  Matthew really listened to all my needs for a new tractor and worked with me to identify the ideal machine, and at a price that beat all competitors by over 10%.  He then went above and beyond to secure financing at 0% APR so that I could even throw in some pallet forks which I was going to have to put off.
The tractor I purchased (B3350 SUHSD w/ LA534 loader) was a very rare configuration and model, so there were a couple features that we had thought were standard but reading the documentation from Kubota revealed they were optional and at a cost.  Matthew brought the whole deal home by listing those features and getting them for me either at cost or thrown in.  I left knowing I had the best deal and with the best service experience!
I will definitely be back, and would recommend Champlain Valley Equip to anyone who would listen!",1
Great service,1
They're fair priced and their work is professional.,1
"This is a great neighborhood shop that gives you five star service at three star prices.  More importantly they have a rock solid reputation for being dependable, honest, and serving with integrity.",1

Friendly staff,1
Adopted a cat here. They were super helpful with the adoption process. I would highly recommend adopting from them. 10/10,1
Ladies at the desk were great.  Not a ton of selection which is great.  We saw a cat online but had been adopted previous day.  Wish it was updated more.  We came home with a new family member.,1
"Amazing, dedicated staff...and great care for the temporary residents they have.",1
"Good hours for a small town store. Coffee was hot but a bit weak. Lots of emergency staples if you need something quick and don't want to run to Morrisville. As with all Vermont country stores expect to pay a little more but be met with friendly customer service and lots of ""local news"".",1
Great prices great people,1
Love dollar General,1
Not very helpful,1
"(Translated by Google) We found what we needed.

The best little country store in central Vermont. If Al does not have it he knows where you can find it.,1
Loved it.,1
"A wonderful spot to get some laundry done. Reasonable prices to definitely get your clothes cleaned! In roughly an hour you can have a large load washed & dried and on your way home for hardly $6.50. They use a punch card for a free load after ten washes. They have AC and free WiFi, and it is always clean inside!",1

Great place near my camp. Large inventory very helpful staff,1

Many fabric's and helpful employees,1
"I want to thank Wayne and Grace Zimmer  and all nurses for outstanding care. Today, Grace and Jessie and Mike were the best. I thought my ear was toast but with these procedures, I knew I was good when Mike said he could see my ear drum. I appreciate the outstanding care I have gotten from Wayne, Grace, and all assistants. It is so nice to hear in stereo again. Also the second opinion, colonoscopy, Dr. Schwartz, literally made my GI feel great since. I appreciate the CHC all for everything. Folks super devoted to helping others and not for money either.",1
"Great healthcare folks here; never have disappointed and always helped me.  The dental receptionist folks can be very rude, but the dentists / hygienists are angels.  Sliding scale is outstanding.",1

Small but nice,1
Nick was great to work with. We were recently buying our first home and had no idea what we were doing and Nick went out of his way to help explain everything and provide advice. I can't recommend him enough!,1
Nick was fantastic to work with. Was always available to answer questions and did a great job explaining the entire mortgage process. Made the entire experience stress free. Highly recommended.,1
I have gone there for 5 yrs and will keep going.,1
great service!,1
Great personal car service. Small but detail oriented mechanics who know customers personally. One of the best auto service shops in town.,1
Good shop honest and fair. Thanks,1
Great customer service,1
Thanx,1
"Why buy new when chances are you could find it used and at a small fraction of the original price?  While mostly office-related supplies, there are also one-of-a-kind items that come from any of the state government offices and operations. From an old darkroom timer, to an old firetruck. Great deals on laser printers.",1
Different selection every time I go.  Has a flea market feel to it.,1
For all your state surplus needs!,1
The best...well maintained...plenty of space...machines wash clothes clean...portion your loads ...awesome,1
A place set-up to get the job done... nothing fancy but very functional.,1
An honest mechanic ... nuff said.,1
Best service station in Bennington vt.,1
Awesome selection and always find something new and fun,1
Super helpful with the renting of a trailer. I've rented a fair number of Ryders and UHauls and I swear I've never had someone so caring hook up to my truck. Treated me like a neighbor and not just a customer.,1
"When I was a kid, Greg used to fill up my bike tires and tighten it up or replace parts after did some dumb stuff. As an adult, this was the only place I would bring my car for any work. This is easily the best auto shop I’ve come across & not just in Rutland!",1
"Since moving to Rutland in 2011, Greg's Auto is the only place my husband and I have taken out vehicles for repairs. They are honest, hard working and usually do the job for less than they quote. Great group of guys who are dedicated to amazing service.",1
Best place to purchase gasoline. They pump it for you with a smile! Great service!,1
Yummy ice cream,1
Inexpensive.,1
Delicious!,1
We have been using VTel Wireless for about a year now. Service has been fantastic. Never a hiccup or outage. Just called them up had the modem next day and good to go. Plenty fast enough and the data cap really hasn't been a bother.  We are at about $90 a month but given the alternatives on my road (satellite and dial-up and contract cell) its the best choice. You guys rock.,1
Professional.  Welcomed my pet. Tasty apple from the barrel. Fastest Internet fiber optic,1
"Good customer service, comparable rates.",1
Got the job done,1
Gotta keep those wheels clean,1
"The studio center is a wonderful place in town to see lots of cool art. I recommend looking at which artists are in/looking at the hours because it's not always open studio. Certainly, though, worth the trip. When they have open nights, there's some incredible stuff.",1
Could use a little more meat,1
"It appears I'm just going to be repeating in this review, but oh well. Service was decent and the restaraunt was nice. The deviled eggs were terrible, no one at the table grabbed a second one. I ordered steak, well done. The thing must have had 1/4"" of char on it, both sides. The ""bacon dust"" the use is very odd in texture, and has very little taste. I don't believe it belongs on food, my wife was in agreement on both points. The fries were pretty good if you could get past most of them being less than a inch long, and my wife said her burger was good. I expected better for the price. I guess this explains why the dining area was practically empty and prohibition pig had a 90 min wait on a table",1
"Great cod and corn bread, brussels sprouts w/maple bacon, crazy nachos and a heart of palm po'boy in need of something more...but generally very good!",1
"Allium is pretentious and uncomfortably neuvo-riche. They don't make any effort to make you ever want to come back because they don't expect you to.   Attempting to cater to visitors to Stowe, they forget that they're actually in Waterbury, and have made it abundantly clear that they have no interest in truly local products, music or art, while all the time pretending that they do.  I certainly won't frequent this place and wonder why they bothered to set up shop in Waterbury where they have no interest at all in the Community.",1
"It is a great place to get a drink with pool tables available, and events going on throughout the year. After visiting with a friend, I decided a membership is well worth it.",1
Great staff. Good prices,1
"Nice clean, pleasent place to do business   with",1
Parking is available along with being able to catch the bus,1
Not bad parts. Just purchased wipers and it seems like one is working better than the other. But definitely better than my older ones.,1
Good place. Comfortable environment. Can't find you what you need.,1
What else needs to be said? These people love animals and do a great job. If u want to adopt a pet this is the place,1
Great staff and very helpful. Staff shows they genuinely  care for their animals,1
Beautiful hearts doing beautiful things for beautiful animals <3,1
Great place to adopt from.,1
I love this place,1
We got creemies and they were very yummy.,1
"It has moved south on Rt 12 to Bethel, VT, where ""Onion Flats"" used to be.

NEW ADDRESS: 2659 Pleasant St, Bethel, VT 05032",1
Awesome food,1
"Great service, great guys.  Always steer you right 🤣",1
Great lighting not too cold and the concession stand is great!!,1
Had some minor work and an inspection done on my motorcycle. Fair pricing and good service.,1
Very helpful in a pinch,1
Love the Michigan's in the real Hamburg.,1
"The pharmacy here is an absolute mess. There's several decent people working back there that are overworked and underpaid. They have bizarre rules that when brought to other pharmacies I have no problems with. If you get out of there with a prescription filled, covered by insurance, and actually processed within an hour you are the lucky ones. There is one very grumpy lady there with brown hair small build. She always has an attitude and gives as little information to you as possible when your script is delayed for the 3rd time. Even my doctors celebrated when I switched to Kinney for my scripts because they hate having to work with the people at this particular walgreens. Get out while you can!",1
Owner is a real treasure to the state. Accommodating to the public and maintains this bridge so nicely.,1
"B.G.'s is a great small town grocery store with a good number of essentials, a nice selection of snacks, and a friendly staff. If you're just visiting the area and want a truly authentic local experience, pop in and say hello.",1
A little bit of everything!,1
"Always a cool,place ..The fudge is Amazing!",1
A nice shop to buy stuff,1
"Mildly overpriced compares to Thrifty in Londonderry and Chester Fam Ctr but otherwise good. Clean! And, they have a good used furniture store down the road. Food shelf here too and support for community members.",1
Good people good stuff,1
Good store,1
"The food is amazing, the prices are awesome, the variety is wonderful, the atmosphere is welcoming, it's outdoors, it happens every Friday through the summer, and you'll always want to go back for more!",1
"Great service. I have leased two brand new Silverado 1500 trucks from Langway. Have been treated very well. Everytime I go there I am greeted with a smile and get all of my questions answered about upcoming models or about any vehicle on the lot. I've never had any issues with getting oil changes, tires or any other services. I was able to get a small dent on my rocker panel fixed very quickly at a very reasonable price. I had I the truck back in less than a week and it looks as good as new I was very pleased with the body shop.",1
I had a great experience working with John Beshara at Langway of Manchester.  John was extremely helpful.  He listened to my needs and responded to my phone calls and emails right away.  He went over and beyond to help when other dealers would shy away.  I would highly recommend this dealership.,1
Great food and drinks... easy access to travelers,1
Good food and good service.,1
"Most of the employees are great, half of them, however, don't listen. They are continually mixing and or making mistakes on orders whether over the phone or in person. They are out of their popular sandwich ingredients more than not. My advice is less chit chatting and goofing off and more focus on the customers.",1
"When I get sick of McDonald's, this is my go to place.",1
I visited the gas station the subway was in. I didn't go in.,1
Wonderful place,1
This local incubator space is also a great spot to have networking meetings of any sort.  Ample meeting rooms and kitchen/facilities if needed. Cool tech oriented motif/atmosphere.  Lots of fun and interesting people to spark up conversations with in passing.,1
"VCET is an amazing space for more reasons than great interior design, super easily scheduled conference rooms and funformative (fun + informative) events; the people make up a community that is unmatched.",1
"Really liked the space and the work David and his team has been doing to promote entrepreneurship, technology and innovation in Vermont and the entire New England region.",1
Best co-working space in Burlington,1
Fast service!,1
Your average family dollar.,1
Friendly staff great location,1
Awesome cafe! Would love to gather a bunch of friends here for a hangout in the future.,1
"Great staff, tons of games, and the best pretzel i have ever had. Love this place",1
"Esox, is the trashiest of Burlington dive bars, but in the best way. Cheap drinks, a good jukebox, friendly drunks, everything is as advertised. Don't take a first date here, unless they're that sort of date.",1
"This is a dive bar through and through, and is not a conventional 4 star establishment. Nothing is super special about the drinks, the bar is not pristine by any means and the bar staff can be a bit rough around the edges. However, this is a great place to go to have interesting conversation and a pitcher of cheap beer, so if you go in with that mindset you will not be disappointed.",1
Great place if you like dive bars. Super strong drinks.,1
Omg. Everyone is awesome. Will return for sure. Just amazing.,1
It's cheap take your time enjoy the fine line of beauty,1
A quant and interesting antique / collectable shop. Never know what treasures you'll find!,1
Interesting selection - but rude service ------ would never go back!,1
"Great little hardware store.  Chester's fried chicken at the market.  They also have a fine assortment of wine, cheese and gourmet crackers, which always makes me happy.   I guess it's a market for us locals, but for the flatlanders as well.  That's why the great crackers a cheese!  I love one of the managers there, I could talk to her all night long!",1
"A great selection of quality natural foods and fresh baked breads! Friendly service, too.",1
"Easy, fast, priced fairly. For quick turn change overs or tires you could do a lot worse. Online reservations are useless when they are busy. Just call. Knocked tham back to 3 stars for that and price. $120 for a tire changeover felt high.",1
Good people and great service five star rating all the way!,1
"Had a tire change over and new rims installed. Service was excellent! Very nice store, staff was friendly. The work was completed quickly with no wait at a very reasonable fee. Thanks!",1
"You're unable to enter the store more than 3 ft, they've set up a makeshift counter out of old wood & you have to give them your list of what you're after, which actually saves me money because I have a habit of buying things I don't need when I browse lol but yeah I hope it goes back to normal soon!",1

"Staff was awesome! Great experience, and found a seltzer I love!",1
Amazing experience! Cool place to chill with friends and throw axes,1
Matt and staff are the best groomers and boarders we have ever had the pleasure to work with. Whenever we visit the Burlington area we take our girl to have her own Airbnb/spa experience! She is always hesitant to leave.,1

"Dr Kellner & staff have taken very good care of me for 9 1/2 yrs.  They suggest what's best for me but allow my mom to make decisions on what's best for her too.
I can't say enough good things about them!",1
Fantastic veterinary care. Great staff.,1

Great antique place,1
nothing says summer like the scent of laundry co-mingled with the TASTIES CREEMEES and kindest service this side of the Rio Grand? Or do I mean the Winooksi? Top notch flavors and great music too. 100% recommend,1
"We love their scratch made creemee base and are so excited they have Curly Girl Pops and Miss Weinerz Donuts!! The rotating flavors keep things interesting, and keep us coming back for more",1
"Little Gordo has some of the best creemee flavors in VT! Tons of unique toppings (peanut brittle, fruit loops, creme brûlée!) and out of this world creemee flavors (horchata, matcha, peach, their maple/coffee is my personal favorite!).  They are always so friendly whenever we go (we even got a free puppy sundae the first time we went!) I highly recommend you visit them, you won’t be disappointed!",1
"Staff and dentist very professional, provide quality dental services. I have been going to this dental office for several years and highly recommend them. I have never had a bad visit and they ensure a nearly pain free dental experience.",1
Very friendly and helpful service. A great crew and knowledgeable staff.,1
The buying process was awesome. The crew that showed up to put the two halves together was great. The next crew we got was horrible. The lead person was here maybe five six hours a day and we had concerns regarding him. Follow-up care was good. Two of the three guys that showed up to complete the first crew mistakes ( which seems alot) helped us out. There's different crews that show up. Our doors still don't line up right and has gaps. They do follow up however our one years about up and still things are still not right. We had a rainstorm where the rain hit the door and was literally coming through the cracks in the door. The vet was never done for the propane to let water escape so it ruined underneath our floor and we have a bump in it which has never been fixed. We were told by one of their employees that the house wasn't lined up right that's what causes the gaps in the doors. The pipes weren't installed right which caused leaks and having them to come out which we don't know the extent beyond them just replacing the baseboard which is all they were willing to do. What we thought we were getting and what we finish with is not the same product as what you see at their location or at their project site in Barre Town. Remind you this home is not even a year old and people have been out at least five to six times.,1
Not bad place just make sure they have your order right,1
Fast service and nice greeters!,1

Great place to have work done to ur car,1
Awesome repair shop. These are the only mechanics I trust. Another shop said I needed 4 new tires since I had a flat. Since my car is all wheel drive they said I neded to replace all 4 wheels for 700$. I then took the car to Kyle's and they said my bad tore was fine and patched my tire for 30 bucks. Drove on it for two more summer seasons. That is why I only trust my car to Kyle.,1
Kyle and Josh are by far an amazing team. One can't fix it they work together at it. Jade is the one to go to for uhaul and she is the girl for the gasing you up. Awesome team here.,1
Kyle is a hands on proprietor who can do just about anything to cars and trucks. He is friendly and scrupulously honest. If he can't handle your repair he is quick to recommend his local colleagues.,1

We are thankful for these opportunities and will be back next weekend to visit and play some more!",1
No kill  shelter. Contributions for their  addition  welcomed.  Adopt.,1

"I called to get information about if I could get a strep test there, since it says urgent care. I explained that I moved here from CT and that there are walk in clinics (not urgent care) in CT. I was just trying to get some clarity on how it played out since I'm afraid I'm contagious and I'm currently deeply grieving loss of my cat who died a few days ago (so crying on and off every 10 minutes or so). Melissa on the phone had made the assumption that I was just trying to get in and out as quick as possible, or get to be first in line. I honestly was hoping she would direct to a non emergency clinic but maybe thats something they dont do in VT? She kept saying  ""urgent care is in our name,"" and was incredibly passive aggressive to me. Melissa you don't know why people are coming into you or what type of day or week they've had (in my case the worst week of my life). Kindness goes a long way and I hope you and your bosses have a good conversation about practicing empathy in medical care. I pray that if you are ever in as vulnerable a place as I was today that people will be much kinder to you then you were to me. I would be happy to review elsewhere if it will help people not be treated the way I just was.",1

"It's a great place to park and fish and also to relax in a atmosphere for disabled people who are homeless and living in their Vehicles which shouldn't be happening to anyone during this pandemic! The State of Vermont got a hefty paycheck from the Federal Government Agencies and I just recently read an article about how Vermont want's to use most of the money that is supposed to be helping people out of their situations! But of course the government of Vermont wants to put 99%of the money back in too the General Funds that good ole Vermont have spent on the people that where homeless or lost their homes because of a disease that came from another country as usual. Vermont voters actually voted for these greedy SOB's and they are still not supporting their Residents of Vermont but yet lining their pockets with federal government aid for themselves in their own homes before they spend it for what it was meant to be used for! ELECTIONS are just around the corner and don't vote for these people who are in office right now! Our Democratic leaders are the only ones who have a heart and they make sure that these greedy Republicans are keeping most of it for themselves! Thanks Bernie Sanders, Peter Welch and and the others who are looking out for the people who are really trying to stay afloat during this pandemic.

How can people that aren't familiar with device recovery with tools such as Odin or Fastboot work as phone technicians???? It baffles me that any cell carrier would employ people that clearly aren't qualified. Same goes for the Verizon store at the green mountain plaza. It is a joke. I have personally fixed phones that were bricked due to failed updates and the store claims the phone is not repairable and instead pushes for the customers to purchase a brand new device or file a claim if insured. With some basic device recovery knowledge all were fixed mostly using just Fastboot. With almost all devices being android or apple they should have training in simple recovery for both platforms. I bet they wouldn't know what dfu mode was. Educate or rehire qualified individuals to actually serve your customers.,1

"Heavenly: A Modern Journey of Classic Taste

Every visit to Bistro de Margot is a delightful experience, especially when you know what to expect. Our last night's dinner was no exception.

An elegantly casual setting is extremely inviting, the staff is professional yet warm and friendly, and the menu conquers your taste buds before you even get a chance to sample all those French-titled wonders. It's an extremely accessible establishment without a snooty pseudo-French attitude (think Chez Paul in Blues Brothers, the movie). As owners of a Modern Vermont Bed & Breakfast in Shelburne (who love to provide guidance and local advice to our guests), we personally experience every restaurant we recommend.

Everything we tried last night was heavenly: freshly made duck terrine, chilled pea soup (soupe glacée de petits pois sounds so much more poetic in French!), the Niçoise, and the striped bass. A seasonal blueberry tart and Crème Brûlée (with a nice candied orange peel twist) sweetened the sorrow of having to say au revoir.

Food quality was good. They have half price burgers on Monday (7$) which is a really good deal. The place is clean. The staff are friendly. However preparation time of the food was a little bit long. There restaurant was not that busy the night that we went and it took almost 40 minutes for 4 burgers. I like the place.,1

Noel T. Liddy is definitely the person to talk to about getting a new vehicle!,1
"When asking yourself who should I talk to about buying a vehicle the answer is NOEL LIDDY!!

Our experience with Noel Liddy was one of the best experiences we have had at any dealership. If it wasn't for Noel we would have walked away from the Jeep we intended to purchase. Noel supports his customers, gives them space to make decisions and really makes you feel at home.  Noel would do anything for you to ensure your experience is positive, unlike many other sales consultants who are pushy Noel was far from pushy and was very easy to talk to and very easy going and funny.

I have never dealt with a man with such high integrity, high standards for himself and professionalism. I will be seeing Noel Liddy again when I am purchasing and or looking at leasing a vehicle.

I would additionally like to add that Brian the owner of Goss Dodge is a very stand-up man and makes sure that each and every customer is taken care of.",1

Trash shop that know nothing about cars we brought my mother's car there for a oil change they did a inspection on the front end and Chris ferdanan quoted it needed a inner tie rod end took us to look at the part and upon inspection It was not the tie rod it was the control arm bushings he fought up and down that it was the tie rod so we took it back to our shop to have DMV inspect the car and confirmed the same thing as I said the control arm bushings. Becareful of this place a bunch of part swappers that have no idea what's going on under the hood of a car if you make the mistake to have service done here get a second option or you will get taken for a money ride. DON'T GO HERE WORST PLACE FOR YOUR CAR!!!!!!,1
Reap off! I was charged almost $400 to change a few inches on my muffler.,1
So today I took my mom's car to get a oil change and they did a safety inspection like they do with every car. We went to pick up the car after work and they said there were a few issues with the car so they took us to the shop to see what was wrong and the tech Chris ferdanan was there they showed us the issues and tryed to up sell parts and they didn't know what they were talking about when I called him out on it! My family has had a shop for over 50 years with some of the best techs in the state. I grabbed the the rod and no clunk like he said then he said it was leaking oil but no oil appeared on the ground so dates the leak? These guys are a bunch of jokes with a shop acting like they know what they are talking about! They have a ase plack on the wall but to display one 3 out of the 4 guys in the shop have to have the cert no one in the shop has one of you check the database! Liers and retards for sure don't take your car here at all you will regreate it!!!!,1

"Apparently if you order a larger sandwich.. I ordered 3 foot longs... with extras.. that makes it impossible to fold ..and the employee didn't like that... so the retaliation was to drown said sandwiches with condiments til the bread was absolute mush and complain about having to cut said sandwich in half...and yes the manager was there instigating the employees behavior.

!!!!!WORST SUBWAY EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!",1
"This place honestly is a joke. They are always filthy as hell when I go in plus on top of it they do not ever get my order right. I hand the college (I assume is bright enough) cashier my 20 for a 10 dollar sandwich yet she keeps the rest.... I am not tipping you nor am I ever giving you one. Can you honestly just not make correct change or are you unable to do that, but somehow be hired by subway one of my favorite places to eat. Since my experience with you I will no longer be dining here nor any subway for that matter. So honestly subway if you're out there please ditch the people here and return it to it's glory!! I am very dissatisfied subway. I wish I could give less then one star.",1

I had no idea where to park my car, but my son and I hopped on the trail and trekked through the woods for about two hours looking all around. Pretty cool trail system lots of turns and different paths to choose.
I feel like this is something that a lot of people I've talked to don't even know exist oh, but then I mentioned it to another friend whose only lived here for a couple years and they know exactly what I'm talking about and where it is.

Ray Beane is the only shop around where I get good mileage out of the tires because they align a vehicle right the first time. I get twice the life from Ray Beane tires than anywhere else.

"Gary and the Double G crew are the best. My family has been going here for years. Super honest, and they always get the job done as efficiently as possible. My insurance quoted a new exhaust for 1000$, Gary welded it for 115$. My car always drives better every time I get it back from them. I always recommend Gary.

1 thing want you to all know POCKET PETS. Its a booth at the fair and they sell sugar gliders. They are tiny teeny animals that are clean and easily maintained and live in your pocket if you desire. Potty trainable. Cheap feeding. AMazing pets. They only are able to gestate 1-2 times in a year so they are quite rare. The main breeders are out of ft meyers florida. LOOK THEM UP. Fall in love,1

"“If it doesn’t fit in the fry basket or on the grill you won’t find it here” Amy Vetters  counter girl and daughter to one of the owners of the Hoagie Hut smartly replied as a customer jokingly asked to be rung up for a fruit, yogurt and granola plate.

And that has been the secret to the success of Brothers Gary and Jamie Vetters who will be celebrating 38 years in business this October.  They put out a tasty, basic menu and give their customer more than ample servings for the money.

Serving up menu items like mixed Italian cold cut sandwiches, hamburgers, Montreal smoked meat sandwiches and the ever popular hot sausage plate no one ever leaves this place hungry.

Perhaps the single best sandwich value in Chittenden County is their steak hoagie special.  Real shaved rib eye steak that is hand cut and then grilled with sweet onions, green peppers and held together with American cheese all mounded high on top of a locally produced Koffee Kup grinder roll.  This is served with a mountain of steak fries and large fountain soda for the unheard of price of only $9.95.

Even Jillian Michaels could find a satisfying meal here.  A selection of garden salads, chef’s salads, tuna salad and a Cajun chicken salad make a well rounded menu that will satisfy everyone’s desire for something good to eat.

On Sundays there is even a breakfast service that Chef Gary comes in especially for.  Offering a selection of breakfast stand-bys to include omelets, eggs made your way and French toast.  Be sure to get Gary’s special Sunday home fries.  Red skin potatoes that are quartered, fried and spiced as only Gary can.

To all the demanding mothers out there, look for what might go unnoticed.  Cleanliness is number one here.  From customer tables that are cleaned between each service to ultra clean washrooms there is attention and execution to detail here.  You’ll truly be able to feel relaxed and at ease when dining at the Hoagie Hut.

If your dining solo you’ll appreciate that the Hoagie Hut offers all the papers to their customers.  In addition to the Free Press the NY Post and NY Daily News are all available.  If you like the Yankees there will be plenty to talk about with owner Jamie Vetters, if not appreciate that he is a die-hard sports fan.

If you have any room left after one of the Hoagies Huts fabulous meals there is a selection of cakes from Madeleines Bakery of Milton VT offered.  Cake selections are rotated regularly.  This week’ choices were coconut cake, carrot cake and vanilla bean cake.

Judging from the trades’ people, families, landscape crews and other hungry folk that frequent the Hoagie Hut the Vetters brothers have gotten it right.

Located at 164 Porters Point Road in the strip mall directly across from the Sunset Drive In the Hoagie Hut is open Monday-Saturday 11-8 and Sundays from 8-4. Cash only.  Phone 863 6655.  Give them a try.",1

Butler family Auto is our go-to place for getting fuel oil are fuel oil prices are cheaper than anyone else's they're willing to deliver 50 gallons when most places want at least a hundred they're very cost-effective for those people on a budget.I will say about three years ago I pulled in there and got gas for one of my vehicles and there was so much water in it I spent over a hundred bucks and products to try to clear it out and eventually had to have my tank dropped and cleaned before it started working right but again that was 3 years ago,0

It's a deli though, not a restaurant,  so they don't have table service or a quiet dinning area,  so don't expect candlelight and cloth tablecloths.",0
Eastern Dragon was a suggestion from my sister. We had pork fried rice and scallops (which I do think we're white fish-not sure though) but they did taste good. Server was quick. Clean place.,0
I've always enjoyed the pizza here. They also offer a nice selection of Grinders here. Pizza in my experience is a great lunch or dinner food and most every person has strong opinions as to what style of pizza makes for the best pizza. As tempted as I am to say this is the best pizza restaurant in the world I must respect the many ways pizza is made and the variety preparation of crust.  I will say that I have never received a bad pizza from this great family operated restaurant.  They are curtious and make everyone that eats here feel welcomed as if we are family. The ingredients used are fresh and of high quality and you can taste it . This place will not disappoint you.  Take out or eat in you will enjoy the experience as I have since the early 1990s.  Thanks for reading my opinion.,0

Some of the meats were okay. Noticed some fish were a little dried out same with the meats. They really liked to season meats with different styles of sauces and breading.,0
"The Craftsbury Outdoor Center is one of my favorite spots in VT due to the friendly environment and plethura of options available to entertain the whole family.

"My husband and I have been going to Highland Dental for a year and half now.  I've had two fillings done by Dr Selmi and she is fantastic!  One of them was a chipped front bottom tooth, which can be tricky to repair and have it stick.  Its perfect and looks so natural.  Today I had a filling on my last bottom molar as I had pulled the old filling loose with floss so she drilled out the old and put in new. I guess its a composite material they use now so no silver!!  Again this procedure was excellent. Two things I really like, is that they give you sunglasses so you don't get the glare from the dental light above and no splashing mouth stuff in your eyes, and also Dr Selmi so good with the anesthetic. She numbs the gum really well with the topical before doing any shots and I kid you not, I don't even feel the needle.  And thats really saying a lot cuz I'm a big baby when it comes to needles.  The staff is all very professional, friendly, caring and very good at what they do.  We've both had several cleanings too!  We feel lucky to have found such a great dental office.  HIGHLY recommended.",0

Whenever I get gas at the Gulf station I see this place, so we eventually walked in and tried them out. We walked through the pub to get into the restaurant section. I like the steaks and the wife enjoyed the ribs. The prime rib  is good enough to eat without having to add any steak sauce, juicy and tender. Service is on the slow side at times, and SOME of the staff are not much on the friendly side. Cheers!",0

"Just discovered this new location and happy that I did! The produce section is awesome just like the original location. Not quite as much in the way of prepared foods to choose from, especially for vegan options, but still a welcome addition to the area.",0
Randolph is very lucky to have such a fantastic restaurant! Food and service were top notch. The dishes are original and very well prepared and presented. If you are passing by Randolph on I89 you should think about getting off Exit 4 and driving 2 minutes into town. Well worth the trip. Plan on $50 per person with drinks etc. Fantastic value for a restaurant of this caliber.,0

"The older employees haven't moved on. Before someone with compassion and  a desire to run the dmv as a business, the employees were rude, power-hungry **holes.  I had to deal with a hold out. She was not pleasant. She was determined to make the process difficult. It was not the person who finally took care of my business.",0
"I have to be honest that we did not intend to eat from this restaurant last night at all. We were in a hurry and passing through Waterbury on our way somewhere else. Started calling a different place and ended up calling this one to order ahead. We were told our food will be ready in 10 minutes, and it was exactly that. Did not expect much, and were pleasantly surprised with the flavor and texture of the food. The white rice had a perfect consistency. We ordered orange chicken, general sows chicken, lemon chicken, a duck dish, and a beef dish. They were all moderately good to excellent. I would definitely go back.",0

Delicious food at a great value with quick service! My favorite is #23,0
good cars and trucks that were just too expensive for me.,0
"Prices are high for ""slightly damaged"" or items that were returned to the original retailer. If I'm going to buy a skirt for $16.99 I'd rather get in a retail store where there's fitting rooms, and bigger selection.
Some products are reasonably priced for what they are, others are less than 20% off.

Just went again to see what I could find. A small bag of dog treats which is a dollar ir less at Wal-Mart., Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General is marked $1.98.
Although there's an out of date section with slashed prices, check you items!!!! Most everything in the store is within 6 months past the date the lady told me. So my purchase was o month farther from the expiration date of 2018, and they raised the price $0.50 per unit sold!!!!! Since when do you up the price on expired food?????
Guess they keep changing names to fool us.....
You don't keep changing a business name because your doing so well you want to confuse customers lol.",0

I love ice cream places and sweet scoops is as good as any I do feel you get a little more ice cream at Tim and Doug's in Newport but I also feel the Sundays are better at Sweet scoops. I will say one thing do not order the campfire s'mores ice cream there's a reason they call it camp fire it's because it tastes like the burnt part of the marshmallow. I think I would rather lick a dog's butt that was the  most disgusting ice cream taste I ever had.,0

"I've leased skis here for the past 3 seasons   the staff is very helpful, friendly, and the prices are very fair.",0
"A small giant with a great reputation. We were able to get a vehicle, but most important to us was how we'd be treated. Actually not what we expected, not your typical dealership. Very courteous staff, attentive to our needs, very helpful with the financing, they take community values to heart. The building itself has a clean but comfortable atmosphere which we prefer over a sterile, business type showroom. The offices and service area are visible, staff were ready to engage us. There's a nice seating area, bathroom and a lot inventory which extends across the street, incentive programs, freebies, rebates. Very happy with our experience and would highly recommend",0
Small bar! You can bring your own food,0

"Jay Peak is the only resort I ski at in VT.  The terrain, weather, atmosphere, and facilities are top notch.  Pricing is fair for tickets, rooms, and food/services within the resort.  Every trip I take to Jay is a mini vacation from reality, I couldn't ask for better!",0
"Disappointed in my experience with this company. Y'all need to get out of the Stone age and start taking care of your employees. Kids out of high school making 14 bucks an hour at Price chopper, yet LCT struggles to pay there skilled employees close to that. Super disappointing considering all the people I worked with we're awesome. Wonder why turn over rate is so high. Greedy",0

Good smamwichs. 😁😁,0
Love it.,0
Large showroom. Friendly staff. Loved the chocolate!,0
"The local store verses the online app. 🤔
The store on the phone, and when dealing with the delivery drivers has been pretty fair, and strait forward. We can't say with all honesty that Dominos is our 1st choice for pizzas.  Flavor, and size, along with some of the unique character of some of the local places are very hard to compare to, but Dominos is a like a reliable old friend, when you want them, they are there and never disappoint.
The app, now that has been a big dissapointment that I keep saying I'll give it another try before I remove it from my phone.
They really need to do some more field testing, and get feedback from picky users to fine tune & tweak this.",0
Delicious hand made pies with local beef and quality beer and cider,0
Agway is just a good place to shop.,0

This little shop provides everything Maple and more. Brought back nice treats to share with the family.,0
The best place to grab a bite to eat during the summer,0
"Always a favorite place to stop off. If they don't have what you're looking for for your kitchen, you probably don't actually need it. In the later fall they set up the farmers market inside.",0
Brought our niece and nephew and found the best selection of a la carte candy!,0
Awesome place,0

We just had New Year's Day brunch at Pauline's as a first dining experience. I had eggs Benny and my boyfriend had the French toast. Both were very flavourful. The service was prompt and friendly and the price very moderate for the quality. A true hidden gem. We will definitely be back!!,0

This place incredible! Excellent service and delicious subs made to order.,0
"Great service, nice folks.",0
"I have nothing but complementary things to say about this establishment.  The best part is, from the owner Tim, down to Barbara the waitress of 40+ years, they were amazing.  Brian the cook served up some of the best food Vermont has to offer.  We were just there for the Maura Murray gathering, and they did a superb job.  If I could give 10 stars I would. The wife and I, will be back many times to come.  A++++",0

"I am not much of a juice connoisseur, but I didn't notice the proprietors upped their coffee game after 9-12 months in this location. This was badly needed as WRJ lacks a traditional coffee shop. The ambience, service and food is fantastic.",0
They do  good work for a good price.,0
The nicest small town big market ever! I live 7miles away and utilize this market often because the staff really care about your shopping experience.

A Caring Vet. that listens.,0
"The place wasn't exactly spotless. The beef teriyaki was pretty good. The crab rangoons were chewy. The General Tso's had some hard pieces in it, like the chicken was overdone. The fried rice was so bad that I couldn't even eat it. Tasted like processed plastic.",0

"I love this place! The people are great, kind, and understanding. The dentists as well as the hygienists are all great at their jobs, very kind, and extremely personable.  I wouldn't recommend any other place in the area. They do the best work hands down. I can't wait until my next appointment. I love this place and the people. Also I love going to the dentist,  as should everyone else. Especially this place. My teeth look amazing because of their work! The people who work in this office make it feel like a home away from home! I'd give this place 100 STARS if I could.

The washing technology hasn't been updated in years. The automated bays have only one wash arm whereas I've been to other places where there are two. Hence it takes a really long time and there's often a long line. Also the name of the wash on the sign doesn't match the name of the wash that the automated voice announces that you purchased. Longer vehicles like suburbans can cause the wash to go offline and then you'll be trapped inside. that's because there isn't enough room for the arm to go behind the vehicle. Maybe if people pulled up further that wouldn't be an issue. I don't think there's anything to indicate to the driver to pull up further though. I waited 20 minutes and then a suburban got stuck in there and I was just done. Had to ask the people behind me to back up so I could back up and then leave. At least the attendant that I called said he would refund the $12 I paid for the wash I didn't get. He also offered a $16 wash but I wasn't going to drive the 15 minutes to get there. I wish the Burlington Vermont area had more car washes.,0
"Pretty damn good but as a jersey boy their bagels could be bigger, they season them well and all the sandwiches are made really well. However their eggs arnt made from a pan, didn't make much of a difference to me.",0

"Staff is very friendly and talkative, most seem to know a lot about the animals, Animals are treated the petco standard: just barely well enough to live and sell, they seem to be out of animals often but I guess thats a normal thing. Fun to go in and pet the cats occasionally.",0
Casual dining with friendly staff and good food.,0

Defiantly worth the drive great place. Knowledgeable staff were able to answer any questions I had would definitely recommend.,0

What can I say except that the staff are very friendly and very professional and the doctors are fantastic they really care about the animals and their care I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to find a veterinarian for their animals,0
Great beer great service! Thanks for letting us #YangGang hang for Andrew Yang!,0
Yes I like the Dollar general store it's right near me.nice people work there.,0
Hilly country club. Feels like you are playing on a mountain.,0
The public arts center. Free movies every Tuesday! Performance theaters. Walk through the jungle hallway.  There's a Skinny Pancake restaurant here with live music and comedy nights. A Must See destination!,0
Food was fresh and plenty of room,0
The absolute best local hardware store you can find.  Great prices.  Well trained staff members.  And they always greet you with a smile.,0

Best subs in rutland,0
"Went here for all-you-can-eat brunch. It was very much...okay. None of the food options were anything to shout about but it was good and filled my belly. The bloody Mary is decent and the staff was friendly. The decor is awful, the whole place and everything in it is just so BIG, I'm not sure what ""look"" they're going for...truth be told, I don't think they are either.",0
"The worst customer service I've encountered. I sat at the window for 3 minutes waiting to be told that they got my order and when she finally came back gave me attitude ""your all set"". At the window she had shoved the straws in my face. Didn't speak to me at all but had no problem giving me a rude face. The bag had a whole in the bottom and couldn't take 2 seconds to just get a new bag. Rolled her eyes as I drove away. What happened to customer service!? Yikes..... Management needs to fix their staff ASAP....",0
"This place is a rip off, doeasnt work half the time,doeasnt seem like the owner cares about the customers,",0
"If I could rate this place lower I would. NEVER gets the orders correct no matter what it is. Everyone is walking around like they have no clue what is going on. I can't believe they are still open, but it's probably because they know they're the only ""fast food chicken"" in town so they don't care.",0
Everything under the sun if you're looking for hardware. Great grocery select! Best of all.... Julie makes the best BREAKFAST BURRITO in Vermont!!!,0
"Staff is amazing, courteous, clean, and speaks with you donyou know what is going on. They work efficiently and effectively, and you never have to worry. Top quality service all around!!",0

"I always love coming here, only get to visit every few months. Always get the lemon pound cake. And Salted caramel anything.",0
"We ate here last night for my birthday and everything was delicious, we tried four different dishes and a couple appetizers. The  crispy duck curry was a highlight for sure. So glad to have such high quality thai cuisine in VT, cant wait to come back and try more.",0
Nice place to fish or swim,0
My kid's love going on this trail. Always amazed by the quarries.,0
One of my favorite little local shops. Perfect for gift shopping or treating yourself.,0
Been coming here on a regular basis for three years.  Excellent service and good food selection.  Great wine selection in the basement and natural food store.,0
"Good home cooked breakfast with great portions. Definitely a good place to pickup some food. Reasonably priced. They also sell syrup ""hence sugarhouse"" and other VT knickknacks.

Matt",0
It's ok.,0
"Great place to hike, bike, play sports, skate, skateboard, hangout.",0
"Excellent choice for beer, food and wine...plus the twin peaks connection!!",0
Great Asain market with lots of things to choose from! Their vegetable prices are fantastic!,0
Great deli,0
Great place,0
Went last night and I will never go again I asked how fresh the fish was and was told that that day fresh .  Come to find out it's fresh from the freezer of costco.  Spend like 50 bucks on food the shrimp were hard and stringy. The fish (cod) was greasy and had a faint sent of ammonia smell to it. Threw it all out and ended up on the toilet for 3 hours. Should have known better I'm chef and there was no one in the place at peak dinner time on Saturday. The one star I did give was they had masks on and offered sanitizer at door.,0
Would eat Frostys again!,0
"Great food, reasonable prices, and quick service. What's not to love",0
This store is awesome. Great prices for meat. The staff is very friendly,0

Nice place!,0
"Great good, hard working staff",0
"Enjoyed it. I thought this would accept National parks passport, did not. It was very nice.",0
Quick friendly service,0
"As always great!!! Great food, great portions!",0
"Don't drink coffee so my rating is strickly on their food - good/fresh food. Decent prices, a tad pricey but you are paying for fresh food. The people I was with got coffee and were happy with it (both times). My only complaint...there was food sitting out on the counter. People are not always as germ-aware as I am but I would never eat that. Someone could have sneezed on it, touched it...you never know!",0
All was wonderful.,0
My car is still dirty and has what looks like brush Mark's on it in the dirt.,0
"Friendly owner. Lots of cool products. Was in looking for meal reply drinks, and there were quite a few to pick from. Thanks for your help!",0
"Always friendly staff, great prices, have to choose your visits carefully, can get busy quickly",0
Great pizza and pies!,0
Stopped here after a funeral. While the reason for being here was a sad one the place was AMAZING. Ordered the taco salad and was not disappointed. Also has a cozy Proctor feeling to it which was a massive plus. 10/10 Will come back.,0
They always make my coffee wrong,0
"Great food selection, good deli food and fresh veggies/fruit!",0
"Often very rude customer service. For example, called a cab for a friend and they answered and said sarcastically, ""Thanks for calling about forty times, the cab will be there soon..."" And continued rudely about how many times they'd already been called, even though I had no idea that they'd already been called for this person. Have had multiple experiences with them being short with me and overall extremely rude. Would like to see some change in their customer service or else will be taking much if their business elsewhere.",0
"Great grocery with fresh produce, good selection of fresh meats and fish. Finally has wifi!",0
Fun place good yogurt. Could use more yogurt options.,0
"Staff is friendly but they desperately need more help in the mornings. 3 employees trying to handle the morning rush doesn't work. They're constantly around 12% on the drive thru, so I usually have to go inside.",0
Yum!,0
My local favorite place to eat.,0
"The B.L.T. is forever my favorite, but they have many delicious choices of sandwiches and short-order food from their deli. The sandwiches are the best part though. If you’re in the area and craving one, give them a try, I promise you’ll be back too. Great folks, quick service.",0
Great local head shop. Huge variety of local artists work.,0
It's like a trip to the tropics! I don't even have to want something to enjoy this place!,0
"Love this place, like family",0
Very clean and friendly,0
Good everything,0
"Choose your purchase wisely, it's expensive here",0
Super great,0
"A little crowded, a little noisy, but that's because the food is amazing and people flock here to eat. Creative dishes and tried and true foods satisfy foodies and toddlers. The staff is friendly and fun. Can't recommended Firebird enough. Beware the crowded driveway and parking lot, though.",0
"It's really a 3.5. The real wood fire is awesome creating a 70s and 80s apres ski feel that is the point and essence of a mountain tavern. Good job. The drinks were generous, my wife got the fillet and it was delicious and well cooked, but it came with potato salad which confused her. I was choosing between the NY strip and the special Ribeye and when I asked I was told if I got the Ribeye I should get it med or above, which  threw me, so I got the NY Strip which was good in the middle but not the ends. We used the local coupon which gave us a significant discount, thank you.",0
We ordered some yummy chocolates and picked them up today. 😋,0
Friendly staff.,0
"Our go to place for supplies year round. Great employees, always polite and willing to assist customers, fair pricing and a great selection of items.",0

Great food and staff. Always a good meal,0
Always a good place 4 a quick meal,0
Always super busy here but great variety of food,0
One of the best places to get very good pizza at but the price of the pizza is very expensive $13 for a large cheese it can go all the way up to 20 bucks for one pizza depending on the toppings you get in general it's expensive eating here but good food,0
"Very nice laundromat 👍😎

If you are looking for a clean laundromat with efficient machines that do a great job washing your clothes.

This is the place to be.
This location does a very good job maintaining their machine also keeping up with sanitization of the entire building for your safety.

Thank you ""Lamoille Laundry Center"" for doing such a great job especially during our time of need.

I would highly recommend you try this laundromat out if it's close to you.

Wheelchair accessible.

Plenty of laundry carts available.

These machines are fitted with card readers and or coins. Whichever your preference is.

Plenty of washers and dryers to go around.

Small loaders also they have a extra large washer for sheets / comforters.

Soap is available for purchase in the back.

Plenty of folding tables available.

Come check it out 😎👍👍

Must wear your mask at all times 😉

Stay safe and have a wonderful day 😃",0
"We stopped in here while staying in Woodstock, Vermont. The pizza was so good we had to come back again the next day! Yes, it's that good. Cold drafts, great caprese salads, the typical pizza joint menu goes on and it is worthy of your appetite and wallet. Next time we are in the area we will be back again! The old blue Model A car parked out front next door is a give away that you found this place! Our 1st meal cost us $ 57 and our 2nd meal was $ 40, both before tip.",0
"Great service, relaxed hangout vibe, and interesting drinks but a lack of variety and really without many options to bring me back.  As much as I enjoyed the first experience I really probably can't see a reason to go back.",0
It's a beautiful little state park but you really have to look for it. There is no real signage until you are actually at the park. Worth it to find.,0
"Not a mall. A food market, Walmart and a few small stores and pizza place ( good pizza)",0
So I really like the staff and products despite their fake sales all the time. The one thing I'd say is literally every time I go there it smells like pure poop. I don't know if someone has a bad farther issue or their bathroom is in the showroom but it's bad.,0
"Short staffed today and coffee lukewarm, but great food and friendly staff.",0
"my partner and I have come here a couple times now--we're vegetarians and there is a good selection for us, although I wish they had some kind of vegetarian protein for pizzas etc. the last time we visited we enjoyed a mushroom pizza, a house salad, and the king's cup dip. friendly staff.",0
Favorite breakfast spot currently.  This place rocks.  Super cozy and warm.  Great food and ambiance.,0
Best pet supplies in Chittenden County. Locally owned too!,0
"Good food, good price. I only get delivery. They lose points due to aluminum food containers that are to thin and hard to eat from. I always have to put the food in my normal plates.",0
I have gotten tires here several times for different cars.  The pricing is competitive and the staff friendly and helpful.,0
Great food and great service. Will be back again.,0
"The food was very good and we really liked the atmosphere.  This was an accidental find, and so happy that we discovered it. We hear that the brunch is great but haven't made it yet.",0
"If you need your dog groomed this is the best place. Wonderful staff,friendly and very competent.Thank you for taking such good care of my dog.",0
Service is slow and is over crowded,0
Bad service worse food. My fillet was like eating a shoe. The pilaf was mushy greasy and lacking seasoning. I am still waiting in my dinner salad.,0
"One of Rutland Vermont's finest farmer's market in the summer and winter months.  The variety of food, garden veggies, maple syrup, jewelry. soaps, whiskey,  and so much more.  Try it out!",0
Ummm.. they make you wait 15min AND no public restroom.  WTH?  Lady told me to go use McDonald's restroom. I won't be back.,0
Great place to take the kids!,0
"Crowded, but they have everything!!",0
Easy and quick drop off. They helped me back up and reposition my truck/trailer after I pulled into the wrong driveway. Friendly and helpful staff. We will use them again when we move.,0
Mmmmm nachos :),0
"Food is decent,delivery time is ridiculous.. Always over an hour by the time you get your food it's barely warm",0
A Cafe. Limited menu and good fare. Service is spotty from inexperienced staff.,0
"Kids enjoyed animals. Other activities were either late start and no start. Had to waste time walking back to gate due to needless under 5 bracelet confusion between Fair and Rides. Seemed whole event's goal was max profits with little concern for customer satisfaction. CS booths and consistent music on main way would have been great.

The metal castle walk through needs time up the loud banging issue made it not so fun. Little kids rides almost all faced beating sun with the moving seat also facing sun. Not so bad once sun started to go down. Zero games for little ones. Few games over all.

Sadly Rides staff were visibly unhappy. Gate younger staff were 'unsure' and not real happy ""have a great time thanks for coming"".

Had some amazing Maple Cotton Candy and a fun Hot Air Balloon Ride. Really awesome farm animals.",0
Great fishing selection,0
Great job. Got me in and out.,0
"Wendys is always a great choice.   Great hamburgers and chili.    This Wendys alway has alot of new employees , so service can tend to be slower.  But the food is always hot and good.",0
Nice little village to hang out in after a day of skiing. Everything is extremely expensive.,0
They were very helpful to me,0
Good service,0
"Yearly visit to Jay for skiing, swimming and relaxing.  Really can't beat the price or the experience. The staff are friendly and attentive. The skiing is fabulous. My ownly minor complaint is the food isn't the greatest. In fact we cooked all our meals in our Cabin this year. Regardless it is a great place for family fun!",0
"One of the best breweries in Vermont, possibly the country!",0
"Great people, great service",0
"The place was almost empty, but it took almost ten minutes to seat us. 25 minutes later, after others had been seated and served, we hadn't been waited on. We - 3 ladies in our 60's- left. We will not be back here...ever.",0
The most amazing Veterinary staff. My dog has been lucky to have been seen and cared for by them. I would rate 10 stars if possible.,0
Friendly staff nice and convenient hotel,0
"Beautiful with a ton of things to do! Excellent playground, large pool with a slide, skateboard park, sports field, and a self guided nature walk. Come around Christmas for beautiful lights! My family picks up a pizza at little Cesar's, has a nice picnic, and then plays!",0
Very slow 🐌 nd both DRIVE THRU &  COUNTER always RING UP ur order correctly but NEVER seem 2 BE able 2 put the correct food in ur bags!! WTH,0
"Outstanding  service, and they do an awesome job with their food.",0
I've been going here since moving to Burlington about 6 months ago. Jeremy always gives me exactly the hair cut or beard trim I'm looking for and is very professional. I've only had my hair cut by him but the other staff have all been friendly too.,0
Lip piercing crooked,0
Nice place to stop and gas up. Easy access to I89.,0
Great work quality,0
"Nice atmosphere, good date spot, veggie panini was yummy!",0
Jintina's massages are the best; She is truly a master at her craft! She takes the time to understand your preferences and customizes her treatments for you. You will not be disappointed!!,0
great place with good rates,0
"Small town fair. There isn't a ton of things to do, but it's fun anyway.",0
"Everything I need from a grocer store. Deli, produce,  and liquor stock many local oferings!",0
A great place for inexpensive craft items and brand name household cleaning products.,0
Overpriced,0
"Average experience, but great if you're looking for a quick coffee!",0
Delicious little diner,0
Food is extremely salty and very expensive.,0
"Always Helpful & Pleasant
They go the extra to help you out or find what you need. Thanks Guys!",0
"In rain, shine, or snow, the causeway is a Vermont gem. The only time it sucks is when it's really windy.",0
"Considering the times this is a first class legion. Offering lunch every day the are a wonderful example "" there for the members"" and community. They are having a BBQ for the fourth. Worth the visit. A stop for us always when in the area.",0
"Update: I made the mistake of using Twisted Wrench again and this time they really messed up.  They did about $300 worth of repairs that were never estimated, quoted, or approved.  I was selling the car later that day so accepted a $100 ""whoops"" discount.  They do good work and are good people, but really fail when it comes to communication and attention to detail.

Original review from ~2016:
Three stars for three strikes.  It hurts me to finally write this review--about 2 or 3 years ago this shop took a sudden turn and lost its attention to detail.  My past three visits have all been frustrating--never a major issue, but poor communication, oversight, and dropping the ball.",0
Excellent selection of UVM related clothing and accessories.,0
"A great diner that's old-school without trying to be. Best to go when very hungry - portions are huge and everything is well made. Massive, fluffy three egg omelettes, great club sandwiches (when's the last time you had one?) .. great service, too.

Boy, I'm hungry now...",0
Good burgers and wings. Service was great. Get there before 5:00pm if you don't want to wait.,0
"Birchgrove Baking needs to relocate so that their clients have parking that does not impede the flow of traffic. Period.
They have great coffee and other tasty treats but I cannot be a patron because of....

Every time I drive by I am having to dodge patrons walking out into the street, dodging on-coming traffic all while cars are moving in and out of the few parking spot in front of the business. I slow to 20 mph just to make sure I survive the 30-50 yards of a death trap Birchgrove Baking has created by not moving to a better and safer location.
For this to be the situation for years - it is just irresponsible on part of the business owner(s).

This is not a safe location.

Visit at your own risk.",0
"Great hometowny restaurant/bar, excellent pizza, burgers, italian, salads, etc friendly staff. The locals like it too.",0
"Best customer service ever!  Decent selection of clothing g, housewares, etc.  but customer service is stellar.",0
Got the good stuff here.,0
Dr Bruce is awesome with the animals and doesn't push you into anything.. Works with you on options,0
"Excellent equipment, stimulating classes, wonderful, helpful staff, very reasonable rates. Give them 10 stars!",0
"Delicious and authentic, I will be back as a regular customer.",0
"Hit or miss, seems like a new face every time I go there. Sometimes you get the perfect cup or coffee, other times there's an obvious need for up-training.",0
Dropped my car off to fix a muffler and it was taken care of in just a day without an appointment before hand. I was very happy with the way Garret fixed it and helped to present less expensive options before working on it. Overall great experience,0
I won't use another shop. Island Auto Haven has knowledgeable friendly staff who go above and beyond to provide great customer service. Estimates I have received are less than or comparable to others in the area. High quality work and high quality parts. I have no doubt in the honesty involved. I am thankful to have found them. Highly recommend!!!,0
"Super fun. The hike in wasn’t bad, I wish they’d update the boards to something more permanent. Very secluded.",0
Dressing room. Staff commented on my weight as I was changing very unfriendly,0
A+,0
Ok food good ice cream. Looks can be deceiving.,0
Best chorizo in Vermont,0
"Rude, horrible, worst haircut of my life.",0
Great service,0
"At the time of my visit in mid-December the place appeared to be chaotic and disorganized. The parking area was very congested and hard to get out of. Barely any measures seemed to be taken to prevent COVID-19. Multiple customers were seen without masks. Thankfully all the staff was masked, but there was no enforcement of capacity or social (6') distancing. The salesperson we dealt with regarding Nordic equipment, was not sure and lacked knowledge, combined with very poor selection of Nordic skiing equipment, it was not helpful. But the personnel were friendly and genuinely trying to help.",0
Great place to hit a bucket or two.,0
The always helpful staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.,0
Quick bar staff.     Food is great.    Friendly regulars and lots of room to sit either so outside or inside.,0
"awesome trails for walking, snow shoeing or cc skiing",0
"My hair cutter was fantastic, and the prices are definitely affordable. Will be recommending to friends.",0
"I couldn’t believe this place. It's not the money, it's everything else. We received a coupon book from Christmas and there was 2 coupon for ice cream. We decided to go & check them out, so the lady showed up said we had a coupon & I handed it to her, she says oh this isn't us anymore it's new owners, but I'll take it this time. So they won't take the other one & it's only creamies. Oh & by the way she said they are having trouble with the machine, then charges us over $5.00 for 1. Don't have to worry about us going back there. Oh & I had to give the 1 star or it wouldn't be there.",0
Experienced stylists always very kind and helpful.,0
"Well this was my first time at Friendly's, I waited about 5 minutes then I went and sat at a table myself and waited another 5 minutes.
For the waitress to bring a menu if it had been busy you could understand it, but their were only two tables with any people at them
The omelette was OK but let's face it how can anyone mess up an omelette. Give it a miss.",0
Great workshops and staff.,0
"Conveniently located, good service, friendly stylists, my go to for a quick haircut.",0
Great stop for maple goods and local products.  Get a maple creemee.,0
Good food lots of TV's price for food is good as well.  pretty cold inside bring cover-up . Nice at first but could be turned down notch. Very friendly staff I will say,0
An awesome pregame spot with cheap pitchers of beer always on special,0
"We liked that the soup, lo mein, and tofu dishes were not overly oily and spices were kept to a minimum.",0
I loved these sandwiches so so good I got the colchester which was amazing! A little on the pricey side but it was worth it. I will definitely be coming back. Sorry no pictures I devoured it before I could take the picture's.  But definitely thumbs up here you have to try this place!,0
The best Chinese take out in the area!,0
Will always bring my cars here for service.,0
They are pretty consistent with their drinks.  Staff is usually pretty courteous.,0
Needed to have more cheese on the steak and cheese other than that it was good,0
Could use better customer service,0
Very caring and well equipped.  I would never take my pets anywhere else!,0
Always a wait and staff can be rude,0
Nice beers and great place to eat.,0
"Not the best BBQ I've had, but it is good enough to go back when in the area.
The staff was real friendly and the food was ready pretty quick.
The setting is appealing with picnic tables on a shady deck and some in an enclosed room. That was closed due to Covid-19.
They had run out of ribs and coleslaw and it was only 4pm. They offered one of the other side to go with my dinner plate. Those were ok too, not bad, but just ok. I chose double beans and a small piece of cornbread comes with the meal.
Sorry for the partially eaten food in the pic. I thought to take it after starting to eat.",0
Clean store and restrooms,0
Bought the platinum wash and when it was done I felt like it didn't do a good job at all. The vacuum doesn't do that good of a job either.,0
"I got some take out. Staff was great, prices were a bit higher than I'm used to. They are a nice sit down restaurant with a bar.
I didn't like the food much. :/ I guess I'm used to American-Chineese food... This stuff was pretty ethnic. If you're into the usual take out, you won't enjoy. If you like fancy foreign stuff, well, this is your place to go.",0
First run movies at a good price.  Beer and wine available at the concession stand!,0
Brian and his team are awesome! They are very very honest with you. I'm always nervous when I go to mechanics because I've always been screwed over in the past. I don't think I'll go anywhere else for things my fiance can't fix except for Brian's. He doesn't try to rob you blind and they do a great job! I recommend him to my friends all the time.,0
"What a great group of guys and gals!!! Very nice, great glass and vapes!",0
Love This store its the best....,0
I ordered through Mr delivery to have fries that taste pre frozen and a burger that's bland. I also recieved a milk shake with no straw.,0
No place like it around,0
These guys are great 👍.  Issues with your car bring it here 👏,0
Originally we went in to trade my hubby's Audi for an SUV.  McKinnon was very easy to talk too n helping us. We test drove 3 different Cherokee models then decided to purchase the slate blue Cherokee Latitude Lux.  Then 2 days later they gave us a great trade value for my red 2013 Wrangler Unlimited.  So I got a brand new 2021 white Wrangler Unlimited lease. We are really happy with the staff that work at this dealership.  Thank you for making us a Jeep couple.,0
Very helpful and pleasant to work with!,0
Tasty quick fast food....reminds me of the fair!,0

"Awesome bar, definitely a college scene",0
The best Chipotle in Rutland!,0
Truly the filthiest most disgusting fast food chain restaurant I've ever experienced.,0

"This place is the best place to eat, and you get your money  Worth are there the first time and I was very happy with the service there",0
"Great little shop, combined with a general store.",0
Nice clean store with lots of variety. Cashier was a bit off and slightly rude. She was not shy about what she said during her personal conversation with other employee right in front on me.,0
The pharmacy staff are kind and patient.,0
"Good guys, had everything I needed.",0
Matt Artus is the man you want to see at Handy Chevrolet! He made my buying slash trade-in experience fast and easy!!!,0
Excellent care!,0
What you would expect when you think grocery store.,0

I have been going here to get my hair cut for many years. They are always so welcoming and Patty does a great job with my hair cut.,0
Wonderful and a great atmosphere. Tons of different ways to have your bagels,0
Love shopping there,0
Paper straws are horrid and wait times are very high. Employees are very unfamiliar with the mobile ordering process. Also have not had the best experience with customer service either which sucks because I spend wayyyyy too much on frappes every week 🤦‍♀️,0
"Friendly staff, terrific variety, well stocked.",0
Great selection and service.,0

Quality for less money.  Thanks Dollar General,0

Bird watching hot spot,0
"We had the best time, but I always have the best time at Blue Paddle. When you come here you will always be treated like family. The serving staff are phenomenal and the chefs always kill it with the food. Try the Duck Spring Rolls and the Soy Glazed Salmon or the Gorgonzola Filet - you will not regret it. By far my favorite restaurant in Vermont and it's a go-to for any size group.",0
Brand name clothes @ inexpensive prices...need I say mo'!,0

"Every one was super friendly, and the atmosphere is great. The food was incredible and so far everything we've had has been awesome.",0
"Honest vehicle mechanic who is interested in more than the quick buck. I have had these guys take care of two pretty significant repairs and both times was quoted a fair price for the work (both with parts I already had, and when they purchased the parts).

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to a friend and will continue to bring my vehicle here for service.",0
"French fine cuisine the real deal, done with art.
A beautiful white room of minimal decor, tall windows beautifully letting in natural light, soft music offering French delights like Benjamin Biolay — all that as the perfect chic yet unpretentious setting for the most delicious dishes.
Entrées (description in the photos) were impeccable, as was service, very professional and yet friendly. From the desserts, a cliché such as the crème brûlée was not just another one of many we’ve had in French restaurants — but simply one of the best! Wish desserts had a better presentation, though.
Chef Hervé came to our table for a quick chat and to receive well deserved compliments.
Our best experience in Burlington.",0
Place is great,0
"Very clean, quiet and calm veterinary facility. I was in with my new puppy who had a serious uti just a week after getting her and our regular vet was out of town. My only reason for removing a star was that they took her out of the room for an ultrasound examination to determine if they could get a urine sample, and I would have much preferred the option to stay with her, especially since I didn’t know any of them.",0
"Modern trucks, predictible route times, affordable rates and the company supports local community programs.",0
I love this place! I have been going for 9 years! They just hired a new doctor and he he fabulous. He I'd friendly and kind. I choose to stay at this practice even after going to college. I come home for appointments!,0
"Sometimes we get less than we order but other times we get someone else's order with ours.. So it adds a little bit of gambling to the experience..

"Like every McDonald's they screw up the orders a lot, but at least it's a clean establishment.",0
"it is difficult to turn left onto northside drive from here.  pro tip, exit onto hicks ave and make the left at the light - it's way quicker.",0
Amazing place to have a wedding! Nick and Marie were so helpful and great at what they do. We couldn't have picked a better place for our wedding. They also have great Friday night music events in the summer. :),0
It's very tall. Interesting.,0
Great prices on food and the gas deal is really great as well I will say their meat is not as good as Shaw's or any other market around here but they do have great Seafood Deli priced meat is kind of expensive,0
To much 4 labor,0
Supper good food,0
Good cut at a good price,0
"We ordered Falafel Shrack Plate(Med) which comes with 2 Falafel wraps, 2 sauce, 1 medium fries for $15.99 + Taxes. Falafels were OK, but we liked the seasoned fries. Friendly staff.",0
Love it.,0
"Blink and you will miss this resturant. Even thow its located at an intersectiin I drive by all the time I never new this resturant was there. Use google maps or you wont be able to find it, drove by it when I ment to go there. We had lunch, good price and good food. Only 4/5 stars because it wasnt the best meal I've ever had but was very satisfying.",0
Friendly service that gets me back on the road at the standard rate. They also have an office mascot that will greet customers at the counter.,0

Adorable locale and excellent food!,0
"All the staff are like part of the family. Violet is a lover and everyone at the hospital indulges her. I haven't been a pet owner since high school and not only do we get Great care, but they are helpful, knowledgeable. As a bonus, a few who work their have or had Golden's which is super helpful since they talk from experience. Animal people are the best people.
6/6/19 Violet got Spayed. The staff and Dr. were so calming & educational for me to be able to help Violet after they sent her home. I'm so lucky to have such a wonderful team at the hospital helping both of us.",0
"Economical, fast, friendly service.",0
Been renting from Slopestyle for years. Get the insurance so when your son cracks a board they replace it. Free tuneups make it so worth it. And I love their suncloud sunglasses!,0
"Everybody is very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.",0
Always top quality food. Beat around. 10/10,0
"LOVE this place...however this day it was sub-par. Had their classic grilled cheese and added tomato. It was barely grilled/toasted, and sloppily made...had to pull off the top and reposition the tomato as it was barely on the sandwich",0
Great coffee,0
"Not impressed what so ever. Should have went to Subway for sure. Ordered a simple ham and cheese with lettuce, tomatoes,salt, pepper, and mayo. Not too hard , right? Read reviews and went for it. For starters, the bread was soggy and ice cold, the lettuce was crispy however it tasted like dirt, tomatoes were over ripened, no salt too much pepper and the meat and cheese were skimpy little amounts. So I spent $8 on a fresh sandwich, chips and a pickle.  Oh I got a tooth pick too. I'm just not impressed at all. Will not be returning again for the ""best subs"", I'll spend $6 on a foot long and get the same amount of meat on fresh bread with fresh veggies. All for keeping it local but come on now..",0
Great location in a small village.  Has everything you could need from a hardware store.   Friendly staff is very knowledgeable in inventory.,0
Great place to get our puppy's groomed,0
"My mother was having issues with her car and went somewhere else twice, that’s when I took over. I brought her car to Quick Lube and they took care of it in a half hour, if that. The office manager was so nice and helpful. Nice warm waiting room. I really recommend this place and trust their employees and customer service. A big thanks for your help!",0
Great beers best in the Burlington area. Outside seating and food would have put it well our in front of the other breweries in the area.,0
Great food experience.....love it,0
"Flawless installation, good customer service, good prices. Glad they're expanding.",0
"Odd mix of food and furniture and housewares. I find some great stuff, and I find some total garbage. Seems more manufacturers should get left off the shelf. Staff seems nice. Prices are really decent. I found using point card real difficult for some reason.",0
Awsome store not really any sales,0
Great place to visit,0
Felt like a country club,0

"Delicious homemade bagels, muffins and more! Breakfast and lunch place",0
Favorite coffee in Burlington.,0

We loved the diner but sadly it has now closed,0
"One of the first jobs I ever had was at the ski rental shop. First place I learned to ski and still my favorite among all the ski areas I've been too. The new upgrades are impressive BUT I still prefer the unique, totally local and cool place Jay Peak used to be!",0

"Most of the time the food is good. I find it varies w the time of day I order. It's best during the day. The later at night, the decline in the food.",0
"Sometimes a bit to crowded. Often a beautiful place to snorkeling, swimming, lounging in the sun or in a tube down the river. There's a beach for families with small kids and a big rock you can jump from into the water. All around great place to be no matter the season.",0
"Lovely waterfall with 5 cascades. Quick walk from the road--the trailhead can be hidden due to the parking lot, but, it is on the eastern side of road. It does have some steep ""stairs"" going down, so, watch your step. Lots of people the day I went-share the path and the water!",0
Pretty good food. Kinda pricey for what u get. Service was ok. Bathrooms were clean on the plus side.,0
Stop in for what you need,0
Great customer service. Wonderful selection.,0
Great Optical Place!,0
This place is an amazing for repairs or just a light bulb and tires. I have been to this shop many times because the people are very nice they treat you as if you were family.

They are the most caring people I have ever met!,0

"Great, friendly owner. Fair prices and hard-to-find cards in their collection.",0
"Good selection, even for the kids.  Moderately priced, but worth it.",0
"This place is a fantastic alternative to some of the noisier, more crowded bars in the area. The lamp-crowded interior has a warm, antique  glow and comfortable seating. I go to some local storytelling events there, and the audiences are always friendly and respectful. A really nice spot.",0
"Very good food, friendly and fast service.",0
"Amazing selection of Mac and cheese. However, for those who have gluten allergy keep in mind they fry their gluten free food in the same fryers.",0
Great place. Very friendly service.,0
Good place to shop,0

"BBQ Wings were good and I want to try maple bourbon next time.  When I go again and ask for margarita pizza, I'll mention to cook it a little longer.",0

Friendly employees!,0
Lori is great!!!!,0
Huge selection for a small shop,0
"I grew up going to Mach's and I'm so proud of how they have evolved. This is the quintessential Vermont country store and eatery. The food is carefully crafted, farm to table, local and absolutely delicious! Make sure you stop at Mach's when you are in the area.. you are sure to find something whether it's pizza, sandwiches, pot pie, Vermont craft beer, baked goods or high quality artisan cheeses and meats and much more. You will not be disappointed!",0
Lovely spot in the middle of NOWHERE,0
Pools great. Clean and has a simple snack bar. Rated a 2 due to the fact that if you take your kids there and are not swimming they still charge you the full admission price. Totally don't mind paying for my kids to swim but charging parents who are just sitting there with their kids is lame and makes it feel more like a business and not a community asset which is unfortunate.,0
"Best customer service in town!

The handful of times I have needed something here I have been greeted kindly and helped fully. Big or small, difficult or easy to find, the staff makes a point to connect with each of their customers. It really makes it feel like your local hometown hardware store.",0
Great place to get good stuff,0
"Very friendly service, typical DnD, nothing fancy, but no complaints!",0
"Super nice people, good selection of the necessities. Collection of some local products as well.",0

"I've been to a few sushi spots in Burlington and this is my favorite. Everything tasted fresh and delicious, with interesting takes on classic rolls. I tried the tuna taku roll, yellowtail jalepeno roll, yellowtail ume shisho roll and the salmon volcano roll. All were splendid, with the ume shisho roll being the standout - the addition of the japanese mint offered an herbal freshness that took it to another level. I highly recommend Bento!",0
"Prices a bit high. Awesome building, people, and supplies.",0
The customer service here is the best!! All of the staff is super knowledgable and pleasant to shop with.  BUY LOCAL!!!,0
Love the phone and plan but the guy said there was a deal but then I was charged in full then said my screen protector was guaranteed for life and we could just registered the one on file but then made me pay 53.19!! Had to call and adjust bill twice now!!,0
Great food. Great people.,0
"An awesome general store in a great old building in a beautiful little village.  Don't expect a gift shop; expect a comprehensive selection of staples, wine, etc.  The bonus is the great deli at the back of the store with huge, fresh, generous, reasonably priced sandwiches.  Highly recommended.",0
This has got to be the best commercially-produced hamburger in America!,0
"Chaos in the parking lot and inside. About 90% of what I saw was overpriced or straight up trash and I love thrift stores :(
Very disappointed.",0
"Coming from a larger city, it was interesting to watch the attendant answer her personal phone call, while 7 people were in line, but all-in-all, it's a post office. If you need to do stuff at the post office, this is the place to go!",0
Love it.  A jewel of gastronomy in Randolph VT,0
"Hands down the best hardware store I've ever been to. I live close and go here frequently. You are met at the door by a group of smiling employees. There's always one who is standing in the main aisle, and can direct you towards what you need. Often, if they are not overly busy, this person will come with me and find everything on my shopping list. They are knowledgable and very helpful. They also are very accommodating, once I bought a can of paint and hated it, took it back and the guy took time to figure out what other colors he could make from it, and we found a much better color! Would recommend this store to anyone.",0
"Convenient, but the Mobil just up the road was 8 cents cheaper. Store inside had a decent selection though.",0
"Great local business, good for drinks, cigarettes, lottery tickets, newspapers and bottle returns",0
"The bathroom was discussing,. Bar was dirty and help was extremely slow. Had a drink and left, won't be back. Really gone downhill 😭",0
Best cut I've ever got,0
"We were here for the Express purpose of swimming in one of the swimming holes.  This is such a beautiful place. Swimming was hard because getting into the water was difficult for me. No sand beach areas.  And for the record clothing was optional, found that out accidentally but who cares",0
Didnt like this place way too small,0
The holiday light display is on point!,0
I love my haircut & the woman who cut it was very professional & easy to talk to,0
A huge supply of products and a helpful staff. The pet wash facility is a nice feature.,0
Great food....,0

We've had Orkin service for the past 3+ years for indoor and outdoor pests.  The service is top notch!!,0
"Best dive for nice people in Vermont! (Possibly New England) Pool tables, great drafts, inexpensive full bar, fun staff, awesome live music for all tastes... can't ask for much more!!",0
Local spot for your needs!,0
"No one is on their phones, everyone is skating. Aura of respect for all ages and all skill levels. Supportive, positive vibe. Astonishing great park. Kids show up on their mountain bikes and ride for a while--no one hassles them. There's a Maven outlet truck some days, selling snacks/gear. No restrooms.",0
Pretty comprehensive inventory of necessities at reasonable prices.,0
Nice folks. Great food and gifts. A must-stop as a tourist in central Vermont. But we locals love it too.,0
Amazing food salad bar is great  chicken fingers are tender anything you have is good. The managers are awesome along with the wait staff and the owners,0
"The best (9/10 overall) crab ragoons in Vermont, with regards to places I've visited.  Definitely not your run of the mill americanized chinese restaurant.  A warm Bistro style seating environment with friendly wait staff and excellent cuizine.

Prices are fair for the quality of food you get.  Oh and did I mention the crab ragoons are excellent, I might have already mentioned that!",0
"Wonderful customer service. Friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive to customers. Thank you",0

Would definitely feel comfortable recommending this place to any friends or family.  Edit: Bought a second car from them-it was an equally great experience.  Edit: Third Car. Gets better every time. Thanks again!",0
It's good if you need something quickly because they have basically everything--its just much cheaper elsewhere,0
Cute little place. Loved my caramel latte.,0
Great food. Nice atmosphere  my favorite spot to eat.,0

"Andrew and crew did a fantastic job turning this space into a destination... I had a really nice mocha and I'll probably be getting my beans from them down the road, ...when things have settled down for them a bit.. cheers!!",0
"The sweet spot at the Essex Outlets.  Just a great little gem for local fresh organic, meats, cheeses, great in-house made soups, and a large array of side dishes, salads, samosas and much more.  They feature many local farms and bakers and farm fresh veggies and great breads by local bread makers.  They also serve soft serve ice cream and great soups too.  They also have dry goods (pasta, rice, flour.  General store on top of the rest.",0
Ecellent,0

Great place right on the water.,0
Great service. Very kind waitresses. They'll get what you want when you want. It's a very small local familiar restaurant in the town...,0
1.5 hour wait. Not worth my time,0

My favorite local joint. 😊,0
Faculties are solid but after years of heavy traffic everything is in need of a refresh.,0

"Not a huge fan myself but  nice staff, locals seem to enjoy it, but it's not my style of pizza, too bready, I'm a thin crust brick oven snob",0
The best bagel shop ever!  Soup and a bagel is the best!,0

Just not as nice as Rutlands,0
Unique location with a pleasant vibe.,0
Best sandwiches in Essex Jct.,0
"Always fast service, even when they're really busy. It's an old-school scoop shop and burger joint. The prices are great for the portions you get. Don't expect gourmet dining or fancy burgers; if you want that, I recommend Popolo or Shona Grill. But, if you want a classic burger and a shake, this is the place for you.",0
"Hannaford is your big store, a bunch of little stores through out, a great bagel place you should check out.",0

Actually had what I was looking for,0
"This pizza has no clothes.

Positive Pie owners, staff, and patrons have never had a slice of pizza in their life. Not even food worthy of a nice evening out.

Greasy is not a condiment.
Poor service is not a novelty.
Paying more the 2x the price of an actual slice of pie or any other dish is not boutique.

What a disgrace.
What a waste.",0
Good service and clean,0
"Great brunch spot, they're daily specials and menu is fantastic",0
So delicious and super friendly,0
Great customer service and most parts in stock.. over night order if needed,0

Awesome old time Manchester restaurant. Huge portions. Get the schnitzel.,0
My home town go threw it daily,0
Nick and everyone at Vermont Mortgage Company made our first home buying experience amazing. Nick was able to explain everything and was always very accessible if we had any questions. Nick and Vermont mortgage company truly made me feel confident and well informed throughout the whole process of buying buying a home. When we look to buy again we will be seeking out Vermont mortgage company and I'd strongly recommend that you do the same.,0

Very polite & perfesonl.,0
Got breakfast there and am very satisfied with the service and quality of food.,0
"Really disappointed with how they manage animal owners and expectations of cost. After I declined service for closing a cut on my dogs side, I was charged $123 for their services of evaluation the dog for 5 minutes. They don't tell you will have this charge regardless of your decision to move forward with care or not.",0
"They are professional, quick with service and affordable. Never had an issue with their work.",0
Small and crowded. We went kayaking so were able to get away from some of the out of staters. Found a little pull off and had a picnic but otherwise not much to do there.,0
Good maple creamee.,0
Very friendly and helpful service. Great  quality diesel available here! Great fuel prices in general. I've even had my tires checked and filled here. VT state inspections to automotive repair to home heating fuels. Great prices all around.,0

All star BBQ,0
Nice park. Bleachers are up high. View is down onto the field.,0
Good sub sandwich,0
Great place you never know what you might find,0
What a great spot. I nice beach for those hot days. A large parking lot for plenty of cars. The view is amazing and the lake is quite large. There are a couple of porta potties for when the small bathhouse is closed. The beach is long so there is plenty of room to stretch out. Beware of the ducks though. They are used to people feeding them so if you do give them something they will not leave you alone. We watch them harass a couple who tossed them some bread.,0
"Great place for hiking with kids and fishing, and Troll bridge is perfect topper.",0
It's always clean the staff is always the happy and energetic it's a wonderful Duncan donuts to go in.,0

The wifi is strong, and powerful, so tech people can get a lot done fast on wifi devices.  Be comfortable and chill, this place is amazing.  Be a good customer, they deserve them. (:",0
Got what we needed,0
Tucked away on center Street. It's a great Chinese restaurant. Food was so good! Staff very friendly.,0
Love this place. Have great soup and salad choice with half sizes at a good price.,0
"Good solid market that's not the size of Montana. Friendly, hard-working employees. Wide selection of fresh produce. Excellent COVID-19 controls.",0
Prices  ould be a little more competitive  Other than that there's a lot of selection it's a great shop,0
"Great store, they have a ton of options",0
"I don't very often visit this business, but I have to say I'm never disappointed when I do. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They have a great range of organic foods for very reasonable prices. Recommend highly.",0
Amazing,0
"Alexander's has an excellent menu that appeals to everyone in the family. Half the menu is New England fare (grilled cheese, clam chowder, etc) and the other half is authentic Lebanese food. We sat at a table overlooking the river and enjoyed being in a beautiful historic building. I had the cauliflower appetizer to start and would highly recommend! The falafel entree was also delicious and very fresh (it's baked not fried!).  The staff could not have been nicer, I will definitely be returning soon!",0
"Lots of variety of damaged and past date items. Cereal in crumpled boxes, dented cans and the like. Rapid turnover means there's always new stuff.",0
Went to lease a truck owner was a little sneeky about coming up with different payments first of all i wanted the lowest amt of truck on lot lowest lease payments when i say that i dislike when a salesmen can come up with different payments when you come to leave .  I hate the games salesmen play to make commission i know it's there living but have the dealer pay you some other way,0
Great breakfast,0
Greay,0
Good,0
Excellent variety of both big brands and lots of local products. The staff is courteous and helpful.,0
Friendly staff,0
Middlebury is a great store. Clean and well organized. Great products.,0
"Serious gourmet deli, grocery store.  Nice beer cave,  wine too.  This is top chef quality in the middle of nowhere.  Every town wants one!",0
A really nice cozy place. Outstanding coffee selection. They had great breakfast menu options and even catered to my 15 month old son and gave him some treats as well. I would recommend this place anyone looking for a quick bite to eat.,0
Great antiques and more. Super friendly and attentive folks!,0
"Great local food. Casual atmosphere with healthy, fresh and tasty choices.",0
Love tj max,0
"Good food, limited lunch menu.",0
Perfect for a quick hike or a picnic lunch,0
Nice atmosphere not bad food,0
Really enjoyable place to go and brows and find one of a kind items. People are friendly atmosphere is great,0
Absolutely amazing. Great corn maze for the family. Really awesome place to check out.,0
Great pizza,0
Decent menu at this trail side pub style restaurant. Menu was limited probably because of the off season timing of our stay. But service was fast even with the non-regular staff. Hours in the off season are short but reasonable. Beer menu was good and the chili is a good choice if you need a pre meal starter.,0
Slow alwayss,0
Real Mexican's food,0
Fresh meat and other stuff,0
"Honestly, my best car service experience yet.  Amazing customer service, and very honest  Mechanics.",0
Very accommodating. Good fair people to do business with.,0
Good cut and thorugh job cleaning up. The barber was pleasant and was quickly in and out. Would give five stars if was a bit cleaner and better signage to find it on first attempt.,0
Excellent Mushroom Swiss Burger. I asked for well done and got well done!,0
"I ordered the chicken alfredo - it was delicious. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. The kitchen seemed a bit slow, but well worth the wait!",0
"Just purchased my Toro snowblower from Exit 18 Equipment. The woman there was extremely helpful. She gave a little tutorial on all the features and went through some basic maintenance steps to help keep it tip top shape for the coming years. She loaded it on the truck for me and I was on my way. It was a pleasure doing business with Exit 18 Equipment and I would not hesitate to go back again. Awesome service!

Update: Just bought my second piece of power equipment from Exit 18 a few days ago. ECHO PAS 2620. The service was excellent again! It was out of the box and fueled up ready to go for me when I got there. Brenda went over a few things with me on how to use it and helped me take all the stuff out and load it. I've really enjoyed doing business with Exit 18.",0
Horrible service.,0
The staff was very friendly and got in and out quick,0
Worth looking around.,0
They're great for a big box store. Cheapest cigarettes in town,0
Best place to shop for fresh produce. Good helpful employee's wish the parking lot was bigger.,0
Nice quiet spot with a great selection of wine.,0
Very clean and comfortable place. Spacious and outside seating a plus.,0
If You need help....they got you,0
Amazing mac n cheese,0
Friendly and helpful staff. They are more than willing to price match and help you research to save a buck. Highly recommend them. The longer hours make it easier when emergency livestock situations arise.,0
Great swimming and fishing,0
"If you're looking for the latest craze in stupidly-presented food with little flavor and a high price, this ain't it. This is a small family restaurant in small-town Vermont. The food is good, solid home-style food. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly. If you go during the dinner or breakfast rush, it takes them a little longer. That should not surprise you. The owner is right there in the middle of it all; Making sure that things are right, and if there's time, she'll come check on you. There are a few Greek specialty items on the menu, and the Prime Rib is always a treat.",0
Love this store,0
Very mediocre Chinese food even for cheap Chinese. Ordered a dish with vegetables and it was 80% celery.,0
It was a very friendly experience,0
Great little ballpark. Lots of promotion,0
Nice local market.  It carries a few items that the big stores don't.,0
"Friendly, and helpful.  Got my stuff carried to my car!  Thanks!!",0
"This place is a joke. I was on the phone with Verizon customer support, was told I needed to go to my local Verizon store to get a new sim and that my store was open. This was at 1015am. Store hours opened at 10am. I arrived at the store around 1030am,  door was locked. Sign on window stated ""if you need help, call the stores phone number. Which I did and no one picked up. The store wasn't open during their store hours and wasted my time and had to drive 40 plus miles to next store to get my new sim card. Absolutely rediculous and will never use this store again.",0
Reasonable prices and quality repairs!!!,0
"Got a DVD for a dollar, a really nice Noritake bowl, and some cool Japanese fairy tale books...fun to poke around! Lots of interesting stuff!",0
Very good food and lots of it at a good price.,0
I had the absolute best ice cream cone ever! It was toasted coconut and chocolate lovers… my friend had a hot fudge sundae… the girl who waited on us was super friendly and recommended a delicious type of ice cream… they also had pints for $3.75!,0
Thre stuffed crust pizza was pretty good...,0
They were very well priced but the quality of the work was very poor. There is a crack in the new windshield and they messed up the molding around the windshield. Not very happy with the quality of work done.,0
"Lovely cold quinoa bowls ready to go, a chimmichuri sauce or peanut sauce option gave it plenty of flavor. A nice little space to eat, inside or out, but just a little.",0
A great atmosphere! All are welcome. Play some games or just chill with a beer.,0
"Love the sandwiches here! Delicious every time we go. Dining is a little cramped, but not often full. Staff are kind enough, and the drink selection is stellar. Will return!",0
Expensive but good people,0
Amazing take and go or dine in food. Please take the time to browse the aisles of the beautifully curated Italian Groceries!,0
"Good food and bar. Price as usual as other ski resort, not cheap. No cell phone reception around here, luckily they have WiFi in the lodge",0
Great time with the kids for sure.,0
Slow service and unfriendly staff,0
This is one of my favorite stores I sometimes drive 20 miles just to get the chicken salad and salad bar they have great fresh groceries as well,0
Incredible gem of a bakery with friendly staff and the best gf baked goods I've ever had. I've tried almost everything they make at this point and never been disappointed. Worth the trip if you're visiting the area.,0
Love this place stop at least once a day. Amazingly friendly employees,0
They have the best bagels!!,0
This is one of burlington's best breakfast diners.  Fresh ingredients and flavors but arent afraid to mix some homemade chorizo in with the veggies!,0
Simply wonderful!!,0
Super cute great addition to water bury food is awesome great imagination well thought out....,0
It's ok. Vermont doesn't have a lot of Italian food,0
"Fun Fathers Day outing, no stress, great par3 course!",0
Good drinks and snacks,0
Waitress was great. Very friendly and service was quick. Food was pricey and a little too healthy for my taste 😂😂😂,0
Has never done right by me.  Gave them many chances. More than they deserve.  I've given up.,0
Great Donuts fresh in the AM!,0
"Great staff, great food. Sometimes you wait if it's around lunch time. Only downfall is it's cash only and I never have cash!",0
"Great service, fair prices.",0
"Does it deserve 5 stars? I think it's more like ""do I recommend ArtsRiot?"". Yes! Absolutely! Is it perfect? No. But we love it as one of our favorites. The cocktail menu is innovative and the food is on the healthier side and is delicious. The behind the bar staff is excellent. The table service is as good as whomever is on duty. ArtsRiot has become very popular. This unfortunately is a death sentence for us. But go! If,you can get a table or better yet a seat at the bar you won't be disappointed. But most likely it will be too crowded. Which is why we eventually will stop going...",0
"Best little store in the area. Deli orders great selection of beverages food and supplies. Diesel, Kerosene, Gas",0
This place was wicked cool... drinks and music downstairs... great dinning room upstairs.. food was  sooooo good. Try it out.,0
Great adventure and fun for everyone,0
"These guys are great! Just order the fried dumplings, and already you will be astonished! Bigger, tastier, fresher food than the other oriental dining around here. The sushi is great! There is no buffet, no doubt attributing to the higher standard of quality per dish. I highly recommend this restaurant!",0
Great place,0
"Some of the friendliest people you meet with the best chocolate in Vermont. Two stores in case you can't make it out to Jericho, one in South Burlington as well. Perfect place for those special holidays as well as when you just need a great pick-me-up for you or someone special. Try it and you WILL NOT regret it!",0
I’m a low income female trying to find the most affordable place to have service done on my car. They have two different names they go under in the phone book with two different addresses. I accidentally called both places to ask for labor rates and was treated very rudely for making the mistake of not knowing I had already called. Wow that alone is enough to make a customer say “forget it not going there no matter how affordable you are”.,0
Great deals,0
Good work and nice people!,0
Great food and staff.,0
Oh my Gawwwwwwd!! The cookies ❤️❤️❤️,0
Interesting and not what I expected... some really wonderful rotating exhibits at times. Odd for parking to visit. Good for Burlington standards....?,0
"Holy smokes the maple duck is Insane!!! Was a filling meal for two adults (we also had the pad thai, also Delish) but you have the benefit of leaving not feeling that heavy loaded feeling! We stopped in by chance and this was one of the best places we've ate in such a long time! Wonderful service, amazing food, we're willing to make the over hr trip to eat here again! ❤",0
Peaceful place to eat lunch...,0
"Massively understaffed. I live four blocks away, yet packages either don't get delivered until 8PM or don't get delivered at all. I ordered something that departed at 8AM yesterday and it wasn't until 6:58PM that I was told ""Carrier is unable to gain access to front door to deliver the package. Please contact the carrier to resolve"" over my tracker, even though another package through them made it find 2 hours earlier.

I was told when I went in that the package wasn't stopped and that the code is used often when they just don't get to deliver it. This sounds like faking codes to me and I'll likely be returning the item to the vender out of principle and will buy it local.",0
"I love this little place. The breakfast is delicious, I love that the coffee mugs don't match, I love the classic diner feel. This place makes me feel so relaxed, and comfortable. It's a great place to catch up and hang out with friends. I've never had a bad meal.",0
"Wendys overall is better than all other fast food places available in Vermont. This Wendy’s is no exception. The meat is solid and the grease is the least I’ve ever seen. I am always impressed. Fries could have done with a touch longer in the fry but otherwise, everything is solid",0
Cool place lots of different stuff. New stuff every day,0
It was a bit slow on getting food today but I had the Swiss blackened chicken and it was very good.,0
Vtcan is awesome,0
"I was hoping to come in the store and get sized and purchase new winter boots to wear both for casual walks in the snow and some light snowshoeing. Upon arriving I was told that the shoe department had been pretty busy, but I went over there anyway. There was one customer there currently getting fitted. It didn't seem like the store had a very large selection of winter boots and they didn't seem too excited to help me. I asked about the first pair that interested me and was told they didn't have them in stock. That's fine, it's a common size and it's January. I asked about boots similar to what I had on and the only advice they offered was to ""somehow repair my old boots."" They didn't know anything about them or why they needed to be replaced so I really felt pushed off. They are 10 year old keens, and nothing really all that special. They didn't offer any alternatives or seem like they wanted me there at all. Maybe the workers were just burned out from previous customers. Anyhow, the employee sorta made me feel like I didn't belong there and that they weren't going to waste their time talking to me. I guess I'll try to find boots somewhere else that actually feels like helping a customer. I'm a little sad because I thought REI was my sort of store. I like the outdoors, but I guess there is a reason internet sales are taking over the brick and mortar places.",0
"Best pizza and staff in Burlington, and amazing art on the walls",0
"Eh - needs some work on the breakfast menu. The tortilla wrap itself was bland, dry and somewhat tasteless. Cheese tasted like it had been melted in a microwave. Not really that impressed by the menu, though obviously that's not a local decision in a chain restaurant. Staff was pleasant and friendly enough.",0
Even on an overcast foggy day it's still beautiful and fun. Trails are pretty level so easy for beginners.,0
"Highly recommended! In addition to the fantastic deal, all at Audi South Burlington involved with our recent purchase experience were accommodating, courteous, friendly, informative, helpful, and professional, especially our sales representative Anthony Alichwer. We can't thank you enough!",0
"Needs updating, dark and dingy looking! Food so so",0
Bad customer service. Employees are always complaining about their personal problems. That combined with bad attitudes makes the trip to this store take 3 times as long as it should.,0
"Very cool place for people of all ages to discover all things nature. New modern building for presentations.
I was there for an evening owl banding presentation where they caught and banded two Saw-whet owls.  We were up close and personal with the owls and the guy who was banding them answered everyone's questions.  It was a great experience.  They have plenty of other sessions.  I volunteered for their BioBlitz last September and that was a great experience. I'm hoping to attend more events there and also do some more volunteering.",0
"I deal with these guys all the time through work. Sales,parts, and service these fellas have it down. Fast, honest, and reliable service every single time.",0
"My family loves this place! Great food for a reasonable price, kind staff, take out is always quick.",0
The best ice cream in colchester with an amazingly respectful staff.,0
Awesome place! Nothing beats taking a growler home after tasting beers!,0
Only my 3rd time here.  Staff very friendly and polite.  Got my order right too.,0
"Soooo much better than Ramutos in Rutland. Nice atmosphere, very good service. The pizza was delicious and the beer list was awesome, they had 2 of my favorites. The bartender, a nice blond lady had a good knowledge of the area and I would want to sit at the bar next time to chat with her again.",0
Fast capable service.,0
"Very nice people,  store has a bit of everything",0
"Not too much to say here - this place has some amazing pizza! The different topping options and the wood fired oven makes for a top notch pie. Not only is the food great, the staff are super friendly and it’s also a great value for the cost. I highly recommend if you’re in the area!",0
"11/05/20 I inserted $11 cash and then get an out of service message, refund button doesn't work. Tried to call and their number just goes to fax machine. If they get back to me with a refund. I'll change the rating. shar802@outlook.com.",0
I been and eaten the same food and this time it was not prepared the same.  Lacking in areas.  Took 10 minutes for anyone to notice I was there.  Not busy,0
I have trusted these guys for years. Never disappointed.,0
Staff wonderful,0
"Great place to meet ppl, and get yummy food!",0
"One of the few bars in the Killington area open for lunch at noon. Had the 2 soup specials combined(half black bean, half corn chowder) and it was amazing. Also enjoyed a tasty Scottish Ale from local Drop In brewery.",0
The lines are aways long,0
"About the same as every other Wendy's.  Not bad, I  will likely eat there again.",0
Friendly and very nice,0
Good pizza,0
I love this place immensely. They care so much and want to educate you and its great,0
Great hardware store!,0
"They don't know their own services, then blame you for 'misunderstanding' them when you explain why they're wrong. They'll also redirect you to Pine St. for virtually everything, who will complain about this location (staff there will outright say this location doesn't know what it's doing), and send you BACK HERE. The back and forth will continue forever. If you can't find your package, give up, contact the seller and beg them to go through UPS instead.",0
Great place to take the Gran grand kids fun camp ground,0
Wonderful time,0
The had a tire for my trailer and had it mounted in a couple of hours.,0
These guys are great they do great work and they treat you well.,0
Great owner and great staff,0
Sandwiches are huge,0
Perfect,0

This is a quiet store but really nice.   Really like the people who work there.  They are always so friendly.   Lots of parking...,0
I'll never get another loan through these guys and I'll never recommend them to anyone. Crooks!,0
"Great food selection of soups, sandwiches, desert items as well as an amazing self serve buffet of delicious vegan items.  A safe space for all to enjoy great food.",0
I prefer getting a rental here because they are not so expensive. The vehicles are well maintained and clean.,0
Fun local shopping in little Montpiliar have a great selection of beads for around under $14 for 100 beads will continue to return great selection of Mexican blanket jackets and socks! Also crystals and locally made nik naks!,0
Amazing food and service.,0
Very pretty here. Leaf colors were not good yet.,0
Good prices on wide range of products.,0
Was an amazing visit,0
Great place,0
"Convenient, but it's like an entire grocery store with gas station/convenient store prices.",0
"Great store to shop in , great people!",0
Tried the Dirty Dogs bath for our two Labs and it worked great. They seem to enjoy it themselves. Great set-up,0
Nice American diner with great breakfast meals and coffee! Service is always fast and the beef hash is very good!,0
"I'm constantly underwhelmed here and the only reason I go back is because I keep getting gift cards. Haircuts I've had are nothing special. Recently went for highlights that cost over $100.  I had a better job done at the hair school for less then half the price. Was very disappointed and when I called to give feedback was told there was nothing they could do, but they would put a note in my file.  Quite disappointing. Go somewhere else like Orbit. They may not have the view but they've got some great stylists.",0
Love there food unless they don't have what I want only downfall is sometimes they dont,0
"Ordered a special  sandwich took over 30 minutes to prepare. When I got up to leave because my dining companion had been served and finished his meal(and we continued to wait.). I was given  a take out box with nasty soggy fries and a visible layer of grease. The brisket was poorly seasoned and the bread was sopping wet. My $12 meal was completely  inedible. I called about it and was met with indifference. I know this was a local institution, buy the quality has nosedived.",0
"Favorite cafe in this county. Recommending the Vermonter and the Main Streeter. Great place to do laptop work, meet with friends, or (on occasion) enjoy live music. Humanely raised, vegetarian, and vegan options available. This new kid just started working there who's super nice.",0
Ramuntos pizza from Rutland is wonderful great pizza wonderful service.....montpelier leaves alot to be desired....evening staff is always goofing off. Today I saw a girl worker spanking a guy with a ramuntos paddle then ripped my pizza because of goofing off they need a manager on nights to keep things running well,0
No lines clean store,0
"This Staples has everything I need. Great sales at this location. One stop shopping. Friendly customer service, helpful.",0
Good for holiday shopping,0
"👍👍 good place to get tools or anything you need. With 2 stores on In wells river and one in st j you can get tools,wire ties attachments for your tractor to shed and out door furniture",0
Great place to meet friends and make new friends... a place to enjoy a few drinks,0
Great food and awesome people there to make your sandwich. Always have the good cheesy bread too!,0
Visited and got to chat up the boys working there. No storefront as they only supply kegs to local businesses.,0
"Klingers makes some of the best bread I have ever had. My favorite by far is the maple walnut with a little butter on top, chewy, just sweet enough and so much flavor.",0
Great budget pizza!!!,0
"nice location, good veg options too",0
Had a blast with my kids and grandkids here,0
It was a beautiful spot,0
Always great service,0
Friendly service always and well stocked.,0
Very good. Love the Greek salad with chicken. So delicious. Service is always friendly and quick. Pizza is also very good along with appetizers. They have a creemee stand in the summer as well as breakfast. Great little local spot and very family friendly. There are always different specials listed which seems delicious.,0
"Decent bagels. Good coffee. Stern, grumpy woman at the register kinda ruined the vibe though. I'll probably try again. Maybe.",0
"Caring, authentic, real are descriptors when I think of Bellomo's.  It's another Rutland classic.  Great people, hometown feel, great food, what else could you ask for in ""Little Nebraska!!""",0
It was a good visit and always have fair prices.,0
Nice,0
"A very nice disc golf course, has ranges for all players from starter to pro.",0
"Excellent selection, service, layout, and just a generally fun location. A small cafe is inside (closed during COVID, but usually nice), other local and sustainable goods, a cool flower kaleidoscope, and everything is fairly reasonably priced.",0
"Cute, quaint, a true country store",0
Head prepared! Water bug spray etc,0
"Love the burgers, friendly staff",0
The food was great! My wife and I stopped here for lunch - I got the mozzarella sticks and she got chicken tenders. She's a connessieur of chicken tenders and she says they're some of the best she's had! The waitress seemed very new but was definitely friendly and an older lady (I'm assuming the owner) was also friendly. Good home cooking small town diner!,0
Great place.  Great service and selection!,0

Karaoke on Friday nights! Super funny.,0
"Super friendly and helpful staff, and amazing selection of crazy was flannel stuff!  Wanted one of everything, but settled on a Henley Flannel shirt, crazy warm and love the style!",0
"Came out with my son for some ice fishing.  Perfect setting! Parking on the edge of the pond, so you can easily walk out on the pond and get to ice fishing.  A handful of other folks were fishing, but more than enough room to be alone in nature.",0
"If you like macaroni and cheese, this is the place to get it!  Great food in a neat environment.",0
I buy brewing supplies here. Very helpful and knowledgeable. Quality products.,0
Great deal helpful staff and excellent selection would recommend and will be going back,0
Soccer and little league fields,0
I always love dunkin but when I get a decaf later in the afternoon it's not always hot. I've also noticed the new younger staff are more focused on their friends rather than friendly and timely services.,0
"Sundaes were small for the price. They were good, but for the price you can get more for your money at other locations.",0
"horrible it is like being in your back yard ,sites are  like a football field , very wet and swampy, you can hear and see you next site side by side and back also, staff is rude, rates are high, noise from highway loud, its more geared toward people from florida for summer homes, a trailer park ,  this park is about money, the manager is rude and is always right , he treats you like you under him, and hes better then anyone, no wifi have to pay so kids get bored on rainy days and nights, have to pay for showers , water pressure is low, look into homestead kamperville or apple island resort you will be so much happier then wasting you hard earn money with this place,",0
Get food here,0
Dirty and the help has body hygiene issues,0
Amazing food,0
For anyone the might be taking the bus the Williston location is a bit pricier the the Burlington location. Bigger selection though...,0
This is our new favorite bagel place. Beats out bagel market for bagels and cream cheese flavors and is on par with there sandwiches.,0
"Being a Dunkin donuts person, Starbucks is not my cup of...well you know.",0
Clean and organized store. Friendly and helpful staff. Lots of everything. Home decor is great right now with the farm house style!!,0
"What a find!  Truly exceptional sushi, very fresh masterfully created sushi and perfectly cut sashimi.  The prices are very reasonable and the service is good.  I rarely give restaurants a 5 star review, but this place is a total hidden gem and worth a visit.",0
"They decreased the portion size, but haven't lowered the prices...",0
Good down home food,0
"Great!  Prime rib special Fri. nite; steamship round Sat.  Blue collar, family-style restaurant.  Glad to have the ""not very clean"" & ""sweeping the floor"" folks stay away.  A real local treasure - flatlanders beware!  (You might even see a diner w/ a toothpick - Oh My!)",0
Good selection of beer,0
"Great co-op. Standard as most. Some great buys from local farms, also able to spend $8 on a mix salad. Great place for healthy and local foods.",0
"Clean, well decorated and arranged, good staff, food was a bit plain.",0
"Good prime rib, service is a little slow.",0
Not to shabby if your looking for a deal on some clothing. Some items can be a bit over prices so do compare around.,0

"I have been going here for almost 14 years, I have purchased hundreds if not thousands of gallons of paint and stain.

In the end we had a bad product that chipped and peeled away after just a few months, I offered photos, the remaining product and a full description of the preparation and application techniques.

I was speaking with the owner Dave who started giving me the third degree over a gallon.

He pulled my sales up and had the nerve to indicate, I had not purchased enough paint to receive good customer service.

I told him my painters buy the paint and he had the continued nerve to ask me who all my painters were.

I hung the phone up so angry. I realized a gallon of paint at VT paint was more expensive and in the end cost me hundreds to repair. Afterwich I was left with a horrible customer experience.

Businesses like IGA, Bisbees, or even ACE hardware, have never treated me this way.

Unprofessional and all over a gallon, one overpriced gallon of paint that I drove out of my way to purchase as they were recommended to me.

As VT paint is more expensive I expect exceptional customer service and if there is a problem with a bad product I expect help not what I got from the owner.

Save time, money and frustration, shop elsewhere.",0
Beware your waistline! It's really hard to say no to the stuff in here so only walk in the door if you're going to order their baked goods in addition to their delicious drinks. The the treat is worth it but this is all the butter all the sugar all the flower all the time. And it's done well.,0
"Great meal, fresh and delicious",0
Literally a tight squeeze inaide but thats all you apparently need to get a good expresso here. Had the Maple Latte for $4.50 and it was great; not too sweet and subtle maple that have that ultra maple fake taste. The barrista was really nice and talked about the scenic places and things to do and offered a map of the area. Cups are compostable and lids are made from 25% recycable post-consumer recycled content so that's a nice eco plus.,0
Typical souvenir shop.,0
"The atmosphere, energy and quality of the minerals at the crystal cottage are incomparable to most other crystal shops I’ve been to. The staff / owner is a breath of fresh air. We stop here every time we come to town. Grateful to have it in VT!",0
Great store,0
"Homey comfortable bar just like your local tavern at home. Friendly staff and fun regulars. Good bar food, homemade soups, and reliable hours. Meet the locals and taste the local flavor. ""Where friends meet""",0
"Dr.Kotos is a wonderful, compassionate vet. Very good with the animals.",0
Get my gas and coffee there.,0
Very helpful.,0
Challenging adventure def a work out mind and body.... Lots of fun,0
Nice place to go to in a binde. They either have or can get you what you need for you vehicles and if not they will trie to point you in the right direction.,0
One of the slowest around.,0

"I recently purchased a 2019 Ram 1500 Classic, and I couldn't be happier with my entire experience.  I base this on being in the people business for my entire professional life, 30-year Mountain Infantry Officer/Veteran and a Small Vermont Business Owner.  I am direct, to the point and do not have time for games, the Northpoint Team was exceptional from start to finish.  I didn't think I was going to buy a truck this soon, but I made the right choice coming to the Northpoint dealership.
I contacted my friend Rachel Twofoot (she is one of a kind and a wonderful person), I told her the kind of experience I was looking for, so she put me in touch with Brian Dagesse, he was a perfect match.
Brian listened to what I expected and what was important to me, he immediately sent me video of two trucks, one then another after I provided feedback.  I looked on their website and saw a truck that interested me and contacted Brian.  He sent me video, then photos at my request, I asked for his best quote and immediately got one, did some research then drove to the dealership the next day (still not expecting to purchase).  I took the truck for a test ride came back and bought my truck.  Bobbi-Jo Andrews walked through the paperwork quickly, efficiently and professionally, she ROCKS!!!
It was delivered by two gentlemen that also represented the Northpoint dealership in a professional and courteous manner.
Honesty & integrity have been important values throughout my personal and professional life.  I found these values at the Norhtpoint dealership where I felt welcomed and valued.  This starts with leadership so well done Northpoint has a great team.
I run a small business where these values still serve me well, I do not advertise and I'm busy during my entire work season. I will be sure to share my experience with others as you have earned my loyalty and respect.
Thanks again for the great experience and for being the leader of a great team!

Matthew, US Army (Retired)",0
Wasn't there at all this year,0
Fun bring lots of water and allow plenty of time.This place is huge.,0
Nice place customer service isnt like it used to be but it seems to be getting better.,0
"Great experience, experienced and knowledgeable staff. First time buyers to experienced pipe buyers you won't be disappointed.",0
"We were greeted upon entering by a very polite man named Brian. They had a pretty decent selection of furniture,  bedding and appliances at reasonable prices. We were just there to browse,  but will probably be back again.",0
"First time with Steve. Friendly, fast and efficient. Got a good cut and enjoyed the experience",0
They're very helpful polite and a lot of fun to deal with I learned a lot,0
"Great place with quality used goods, a must stop for those to stock up on used sports apparel!",0
Good family market always have fresh veggies and fruits,0
"We took a ride to visit A family member at the cemetery. Today it was so very beautiful. I love LOOKING at the gorgeous scenery as well, its truly breath taking!!",0
"Didnt go in Because I felt the admission fee was a bit much,but beautiful from the outside",0
"Do you like maple? So you like maple syrup and candy pretending that you live on a quaint New England farm? Then this is the place for you. Especially if you are drive by. However, it would be countlessly better if you actually supported the farms you saw on the way.",0
Such a beautiful place! We all loved the water trampolines.,0
Great food n great atmosphere,0
"I have orderd take out twice and both times my order was not right . The first time I ordered a steak and cheese...didn't come with cheese ? The second time ham, pineapple cheese , no pineapple on my Pizza?",0
People are always so nice here. Great place!,0
I like their coffee,0
"Ordered take out, the hot and blue chicken sandwich was really really yummy! The fries were a sad looking bunch as you can see from my photo... Mostly because they forgot to put in the aoili so if you really want it, remind them!",0
Kohl's has high quality merchandise and you can get some good buys but nothing is ever on sale it's always buy one get one half off and I hate that and a lot of stuff does not have price tags this is Vermont not Hollywood,0
"Sales staff will (sometimes) attempt to up sell you and do add on sales.  Nice location and the lines aren't usually too long if there is a line at all.  Just be sure to read the fine print on any deals you are offered, including ""free"" or ""low cost"" tablets, ipads, etc.  Just be aware when you go here that management is pushing sales maybe more so than other locations.

Edit:  Had a good experience recently upgrading to a Pixel 2 XL.  The manager on duty and Shauna were both very helpful.  Lines here are generally not bad also, which can't be said for many Verizon locations.  I think this will be my ""go to"" location going forward; as I try to keep it local.",0
"Startlingly good food. This time hole in the wall is a hidden gem of Brattleboro's good scene. Don't let the decor for you, this place makes great Italian food!",0
They have the best little deli around. Awesome sandwiches and awesome food.,0
Always a great meal,0
Good food and martinis,0
Awesome staff and a lot of fun events are hosted here. Talented artists and reasonably priced repairs & pieces !,0
FINALLY  tried the PRIME RIB here. IT WAS SOOOO GOOD TENDER AND TASTY. If u have not had their prime rib dinner then vet out and do so.,0
"Decent pizza, quick service, very casual, ambiance is average.  Just pick up or dine in.  Nothing notable on the menu.  Just a good, casual time with friends.  This establishment is locally own and frequented by locals, mostly for take out.",0
I have a food crush on the French toast...,0
I love the different options they have. They delivered very timely - my mom loved her birthday gift!,0
"My fiance sent me to this place because it was my birthday and I was on my third trimester and needed some pampering. I had a massage which was great. The girl was really nice and her hands felt like heaven. I also had a ""pedicure"" $75 and I'm not sure why. I had my toe nails trimmed, had a gel rubbed and top of my feet and then nail polish. That was it. I don't know why I didn't ask before hand. You normally get a pedi at a nail salon and you get a full package for $40 or less. Besides my ""pedi"" experience,  the staff seemed nice. Maybe a little too nice.",0
"its sears you can get most appliances here along with some electronics and
lawn mowers so on",0
A+,0
Welcoming atmosphere. Fabulous staff and the Cream of Mushroom soup and Kale Caesar are choice.,0
Beautiful and relaxing,0
Pretty basic theater. They have 3D and decent food. All new seats in 2016 which is really nice too!,0
Very good food. Much better than Damn diner.,0
Love this store nice remodel too.,0
Everything is delicious here. I'd recommend making a reservation. The duck spring rolls are definitely something to try.,0

"Great pub food and if you like sports there's about 100 tv screens playing them.
Its great.",0
This is one of the most beautiful places in northern Vermont.,0
Awesome view,0
"It's not a bad movie theater, but may be a good idea to leave a bit early, because customer service can be a bit slow.",0
"Sevice good , ice cream awsome. Price too high. Its only ice cream after all.",0
"I used to frequent this beach but not that the college kids have found it I do not go often anymore. Maybe I should just pick earlier times of day.

The water is shallow for a long time. There are stairs to get down to the beach or a broken up road. Either way not handicap accessible. There is a bathroom and foot washing statin open usually. Great place for young kids.",0
Poor customer service,0
Best bread in greater Burlington!,0
Crazy good middle eastern food. Fresh baked pita is divine. The entire menu is thoughtfully prepared with quality ingredients for sure. Healthy and delicious.,0
Hidden gem. Well kept and managed. Awsome views and very  challenging,0
Great food and atmosphere. The staff is great and extremely friendly.,0
Nice,0
Pretty decent nail salon. Talented artists with nail designs,0
"Always yummy, and very nice employees.",0
Austin worked hard to find the problem so they could fix my vehicle and it's good thanks,0
Awesome comfort food and ambience.,0
"The proprietor's name is Exsey. She is a delightful woman with a huge smile for everyone who enters. Try the chicken massaman; it is delicious! Fair prices, great food, craft beer, Exsey's warm welcome and a good selection of wines helped make this my favorite local restaurant. They also have sushi, and opening soon is an authentic Thai gift shop!

A new wrinkle. The proprietor flew back to Thailand to visit relatives and renew her visa, which she does every 2 years. When she tried to return, US Customs refused renew her visa. This is appalling to me. The proprietor is a wonderful, hard-working woman who employs 5 or 10 local residents all of whom will be unemployed if her business is driven bankrupt by this over-reach by our government. Write your senators and congressional representatives to demand they change these new ""zero tolerance"" immigration policies. It is hurting our economy in ways we are just starting to realize.",0
Opening weekend! Great beers and service. They have indoor and outdoor seating and very cautious with COVID.,0
Fast friendly no touch pickup,0
Cheap drinks,0
Have everything 🦋,0
Good clean park but they should have a separate fenced off areas for the kids playground.,0
"Retro atmosphere. Many great delicious choices, Burgers and fries are delicious along with homemade sourdough bread. Friendly staff, excellent prices. Will be going back.",0
"Ordered french fries with our Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich. Opened the box to find a poorly made sandwich, very very dry, no sauce. And we both got a scant few fries, they threw in under cooked onion rings to make up the difference. Not worth the long wait OR the prices.",0
"I rented the bike,and this had to be one of the most beautiful rides I've ever had. I absolutely loved it. 20 miles out and back.",0
Remodel beautifully done and employees polite. Love it!,0
"I had the best car buying experience ever at Upper Valley Honda!  Salesperson Lynette McGee was pleasant,  helpful and great to work with.   Greg Sieglinger made the financial side of things smooth and low pressure.  The whole atmosphere at Upper Valley was friendly and supportive.  I was stressed out about finding a new car and can't say enough what a positive experience this was.  I would highly recommend them.",0
Best sandwich shop in St. Albans!,0
Great sandwiches and salads. and great service.  The people who work there make you want to come back.  Love you guys ❤,0
"Nice cuts, prompt,",0
Looks great. Newly renovated. Awesome machines. Great staff. I don't know if they still do this but they used to give away free washes randomly... I freaking love that it happened one of the last times I went there and I felt like I had just won the lottery because it was a big machine lol,0
Great,0
Staff is amazing.,0
"Asked and checked the Internet photos of a car they had listed as excellent, drove 1.5 hours to find it scratched up on every panel and it had rust. They would not sell it for less than the full clean retail condition. The sales people were very polite yet unable to bring the price down to match the condition. Well at least the place seems neat and we'll stocked.",0
"Good cakes. But, they're mostly out of cakes late afternoon. So, if you want to pick up in the second half, it's better to place an order early on.",0
It is a nice little stop,0
The best,0
friendly service but the place is amess cant get in half the lanes they're filled will carts and boxes,0
"Bought 2 macaroons, a raspberry chocolate muffin, a BlackBerry Apple and raspberry pastry, and a meat pie. $16, not to bad, but on checkout I was expected to tip... I did, not because she earned but because I was told when growing up, people were living off those tips.

Got home and tried the macaroons. I thought at first I had been given the display pieces because they were rock solid and when breaking reminded me of Styrofoam. After warming a chunk up in my mouth it was obvious the macaroons were not from today, yesterday, two days ago and possibly further back. They should not have sold at full price if at all.

The meat pie was astoundingly good.

The pastry was bland. No flavor even in the puree.

The muffin was pretty good.

If this is TLDR, then make sure the food is fresh before you leave and encourage a fair wage that doesn't encourage guilt tipping.",0
I have purchased 4 vehicles at Alderman's and have been very happy. Both the purchase and subsequent service needs have been handled in a professional and friendly manner. I have no qualms recommending this dealer to friends and family!,0
I like the one in williston the have great sales,0
Beautiful family friendly spot on the lake,0
We pick here every year,0
Decent little place,0
Great prices.,0
LOVE THIS PLACE. The atmosphere is upbeat but quiet. It's SO clean and tidy without feeling sterile. Great wifi. The coffee is so delicious! Made just right. My only wish is that they'll start keeping some gluten-free bagels in the freezer so there's something besides a Chef's Salad for gluten-free guests!,0
Good food. Gluten free friendly. Good price for the value received.,0
Called to inquire about a unit.  Got the price and was told units were available.  When My daughter got there to get a unit she was told none were available and said the woman at the desk was very rude.,0
Not much of a selection and the staff seemed irritated. Maybe better luck next time.,0
Great home cooked food and very large portions.,0
A lot has changed and my strawberry coolant tasted like ice,0
They fixed my cell phone which had a cracked screen and I was able to get the information I needed off of it and download it to my new phone so I would say they did a great job cost me about 200 bucks I don't know if that's a great price or no,0
Great place to do a quick (or long) shop.  A good variety of items.  Helpful staff.  New store so current selection.,0
Been here 5 years. All seasons it's beautiful,0
"It was good, alittle messy but that's to be expected when they get busy.",0
"Excellent, helpful staff at this location on 302 just outside Barre, Vermont.
Update 11/2019: Now my favorite DD of all time.
Great manager, too. I totally messed up my mobile order (chose another store!) and they filled my order anyway - on the house.
That's how business is done in 2019. You need a really together staff when one is too old for mobile apps, like me.",0
"Wonderful selection of fresh food and baked goods, and delicious homemade grinders and Bullies.. look forward to stopping in the next time I'm around that area..",0
"Clean, friendly, and professional",0
The service and food is great.,0
Always a good quick bite!,0
I can not say enough good this about this place. Cheap cuts that actually look good. No appointment needed.,0
"Gray winter gets you down? Go here. Want cool air plants and succulents? Go here. Want an awesome boho gift shop within an already amazing garden center? You guess it, this is the place. Wonderful atmosphere, helpful staff and great all around store. Check out their bargain shed - some neat finds in there as well.",0
Many choices always a good experience.,0
Wonderful family owned paint store with the best service around!,0
Great food. Nice people,0
Wonderful food and service!,0
"The all stars of lame! Johnny B Good,R ya kidding me! Yeager is better than all the all stars put together!! Thanks for trying but
They don’t have it!But but the food is great
The buzz is amazing on Wed all the time.
Cool place,try it your self ,wow all stars
Of what??This is only a opinion of the music
(This was suppose to be a special music
Secret I guess?)",0
"The food was absolutely incredible. But I was very disappointed by the service. Our server, Henry, more or less abandoned us. 15 minutes to look over the dessert menu before checking in is a bit excessive. I understand that Covid has made life difficult, but for a fine dining establishment, I expected more. I am sure this is a one-off experience or a staff issue, and I would definitely come back hoping for a better experience.",0
Good customer service,0
Expensive,0
"Nice, fresh cut.",0
"Lots of kids stuff, and there's a separate maternity clothing section",0
"There is usually a range available (they have 5) for use without having to wait, and it's not too far away from BTV. Very good people own the range, and most users are friendly to each other which make it's use pleasurable to return again.",0
Friendly staff,0
$7 for 3 shrimp not impressed the service was amazing!,0
High quality food.,0
I really don't have much good to say about Price Chopper in Bennington anymore never have the things you need and the prices are too high,0
Easy in and out for a quick clean.,0
What a wonderful selection of toys and games! A great stop for any kid or adult to walk around in and explore.,0
Nyce,0
"Bought more than I needed. Went in for a steam mop (found one half price!) and left with cleaning and organizing items, too! Store Isles were very crowded or the rating would have been 5 stars. Very pleased with cost/value.",0
"I was really looking forward to this place when I saw they were taking over for the Chinese food place that went out of business.

I was a but taken back by the prices, they are pretty high for this kind of food. The fries were pretty tasty, but the shawarma wrap was a thin tube of meat drenched in sauce and devoid of any vegetables.",0
Nice site,0
"AMAZING day! Made butter,oragami cows,got to see the cows. Great experience!",0
"What an amazing farm. I wish all farms were raising cows this way. I know it's a lot of hard work. I admire Lisa, the lady who runs the farm. For what I saw and heard, she's a real champion. I hope to go back one day and help her for a day. Seeing the Jersey Girl Dairy makes me want to support local farming even more. I support local farms not corporate farms.",0
Beautiful and peaceful trip! Friendly and helpful staff.,0
Most choice I have ever seen!,0
Cold and took so long. Did not enjoy this visit,0
Half as good as the downtown one not sure why? The one on pearl st. Is awesomely delicious perfect every time!,0
"Excellent service, great food. A little more casual and intimate than some places in town. Great restaurant, would recommend strongly.",0
Soso prices,0
Always has what I need and great service.,0
"I adore this Kohls. The employees are extremely helpful and kind. I shop here at least once/twice a month. Kohls has the best brands in clothing, shoes, cosmetics, perfume, jewelry, children clothing, etc... I only buy clothes from this Kohls because I love what they have for a selection and I always, actually every time I buy anything from here I save so much money. It's so nice to have a department store in our area. Also they are always having some really great sale/promo going on. Example I love the kolhs cash, you get money for spending money. They also have the Yes 2 u rewards which is based on a point system. When you acquire so many points you get $5 or more depending on point level off your purchase. I definitely recommend everyone who likes shopping and saving on quality items to shop here. Thanks Kohls your amazing",0
"Turned away at the door at 9:58pm on a Saturday because ""we're closed"" but Google says open till 11pm?  Glad I'm just a local and not a trucker.

I kinda just stopped going to Irving anyway.  Both Rutland locations aren't great.  This is the better one at least but they're overpriced and don't offer anything special.",0
"Delicious "" real deal"" NY pie",0
Great little market to fill up on supplies,0
The place could be cleaned and could use a restroom.,0
"Their stylists are really skillful and friendly. I will definitely be one of their regulars. Great job ""Salon Salon""",0
Good selection. Butchers help you get exactly what you want,0
Ill be sad when they close for the season,0

It's the only place Misty goes ❤ ❤ ❤,0
"Very friendly staff and a great collection of unique, hand crafted goods. Definitely recommended.",0
Nicely kept.,0
"I went there for the first time for the sale because we were in the market for a bed. Steve was great-very personable, helpful, understood what I wanted, worked within my budget, and found a bed even better than the one I originally liked. Scheduling the delivery was great-we will be back in the future!",0
Food was hot and fresh,0
Awesome place! Very well stocked and the staff were super helpful and friendly.,0
Nice people and good customer service!,0
"PB and his crew are upbeat, knowledgeable, and eager to help. The store itself is welcoming, fun, and very well stocked: A hidden gem in Burlington!",0
Extremely helpful,0
"General grocery store, nothing very special about it.  It's the most out of date Shaw's I have ever been in.  But it has what you need and a friendly staff to go along with it.",0
Nice old covered bridge,0
"Love everyone at Marigold! Friendly, and so knowledgeable, very clean and a great environment 🥰",0
Rolled in with a tire losing air in the tractor  I drive. They got me in and out in about 30 minutes.,0
Left a bad taste in my mouth. Owner is less than pleasant.,0
Just a restaurant,0
"Very good! Food was yummy, brisket, baby back ribs and pulled pork. Service was great, friendly! Definitely going back!",0
Found some fantastic scores and staff is always pleasant!,0
Polite staff willing to assist and ensure you walk away with the correct part,0
"I GET A KICK OUT READING THE LOWEST REVIEWS FIRST AND I FIND IT FUNNY THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THE $5 IS EXPENSIVE FOR THE ELEVATOR RIDE. COME ON PEOPLE $5 TO HELP MAINTAIN THE SITE. DON'T BE SO CHEAP. $5 DOESN'T MAKE THIS A 1 STAR RATING. YOU CAN GET SOME GREAT VIEWS AND TO LEARN ITS THE TALLEST BUILDING IN VERMONT AT 306 FEET AND THE 6TH TALLEST MONUMENT IN AMERICA IS KIND OF COOL. BUT IS NOT THE TALLEST STRUCTURE. ITS THE 5TH. THE KINGDOM COMMUNITY WIND PROJECT AT 450 FEET TALL. FOLLOWED BY 2 RADIO TOWERS AND A TELECOMMUNICATION TOWER. IT IS A WONDER PLACE BUT TO LEARN THAT THEY TORN DOWN SEVERAL HISTORICAL BUILDINGS (INCLUDING THE VERMONT GAZETTE , THE HOME OF THE FIRST VERMONT NEWS PAPERS) WAS KIND OF SAD. MAKES ME WONDER WHAT KIND OF HISTORICAL SITE THIS COULD OF BEEN IF THEY LEFT THE BUILDS OR ADDED THE MONUMENT TO THE SITE. THE LADY THAT WORK IN THE GIFT SHOP WAS VERY PLEASANT, KNEW THE AREA AND EVEN THO A FEW PEOPLE ALL AT ONCE WAS POUNDING HER FOR INFORMATION SHE STAYED PLEASANT AND NICELY EXPLAIN SHE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER EVERYBODY'S QUESTIONS ONE AT A TIME. PLUS THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR WAS KNOWLEDGEABLE AND FUN. I RECOMMEND THIS SITE FOR ALL HISTORY BUFFS AND/OR PEOPLE THAT ENJOY A NICE VIEW. A GREAT STOP FOR A DAY TRIP.",0
"Awesome music,  great food, cool waitstaff...",0

Drive through service has been very quick in multiple days at different times. Can't do better than that!,0
Very cool music venue in an old stone church. It's a great re-purposing of a beautiful building that probably would've gone to seed otherwise. The guy who runs the lights for the venue does an amazing job. We love coming here.,0
"Food is good, no different than any other place. Staff is great",0
I do most of my shopping here! Great prices! Friendly service! Where I buy most of my meat!,0
Great mtn bike trail,0
"I've ordered from these people for nearly three years, and I've noticed a consistent decline with how they handle orders. My last order about two weeks ago got lost due to a technical problem which I was okay with, my account got double charged, and they told me I was given 10 dollars in, in-store credit. I call today to use that credit to find out that it was never put in. Even though it's only 10 dollars, many of my friends have also had money issues with this company. One of my friends yet got double charged by the delivery driver. Bottom line, don't trust them to follow up with in-store credit.",0
"Leddy park is just one of those places we’re you go anytime of the day Free. Yes that’s what I said FREE I no there’s not that many Parks /that you are able to go to the beach,or play some tennis or baseball,basketball or just go for a walk with your cat. Lol or dog or your a special one. It will fun.",0
Good food to go,0
Great disk gold course and decent beach. Kayaks and paddle boards are rentable and there are good picnic tables and sturdy BBQ stations.,0
Great little book store,0
I love our local grocery store owned by local people that remember your name,0
"Big dance floor. It's owned and operated by the people that own Nectar's in Burlington, so they always have interesting live music. The dance floor is pretty big, and the upstairs room with pool tables is also a plus.",0
Local! Friendly!!,0
"Good fries, great burger, pleasant atmosphere and cheerful service. Will be back again!",0
Love shopping local.,0
It's a moose Lodge   at least they let a drag show crash the joint,0

Great place to go for a cheap dinner with great prices good service,0
wouldn't call it a mall but ok,0
The Swanton historical Society has some really cool old railroad equipment including a CV wood caboose and a Fairmont S-2 Motorcar.  I do wish that the Motorcar was protected properly. It currently is under a tarp and has a lot of wood rot due to exposure.,0
I'm just glad they're out there for the animals and people to be able to have somewhere else to bring an animal in need of shelter or help....,0
How you do all day breakfast that stuff NASTY should be doing all day lunch,0
"Has some good options not found at other Chinese food places, like brown rice and chow fun, those wide soft rice noodles. However, the flavors are subpar compared to similar and the grease is extra heavy.",0
I like running the stair.  Good work-out,0
"The owner was very nice, the selection was impressive for the small location and the store was very nicely located",0
Beautiful antique shop in downtown Bellows Falls near some excellent restaurants. We received a warm welcome and we're impressed by the many lovely antiques so creatively displayed.,0
Good beer selection,0
"Where able to get a part we needed in stock fairly cheap, was scared at first cause was not sure what it would cost us.",0
Best Laundromat in Chittenden county,0
Love it,0
A breathtaking view of the Vermont countryside around Bennington.,0
Breathe taking views. Peaceful.,0

"I absolutely love this store!! I can find any and everything I'm looking for, all for $1!! In today's economy, saving money is essential! This store is clean, well organized, stocked well, and the employees are very friendly and quick!!",0
Messy and unorganized,0
Better then the other place.,0
"Great, local cinema.",0
I used this u-haul location when my truck was in the shop and I needed a pickup. It was cheaper than renting from a regular rental car place and the staff there had me in and out in no time. I would definitely use this place if I ever need to rent a truck again.,0
Needs a little more cashiers to make wait time faster,0
Boar's Head deli (rare in VT) also great home cooking for take out. A treasure...,0
Majestic.,0
Found the same tools at harbor freight cheaper,0
Love the food and Razzles!! Love the way it's setup!! Not a fancy place but very kid friendly!!,0
"Always clean, and the people are great",0
Blah. Blah blah graffiti ruins the sight .dont go here. Unless you want to see alot of tagging on cement ..why people ruin it for others I dont know,0
Pricey but good,0
Always got what I need quick and super helpful and friendly.,0
Good grocert store. Well layed out. Always clean.,0
Convenient to I 89. Good place to stop and gas up.,0
Amazing! 10 outta 10 if you want some real Barbeque this is where you need to go. Nothing beats it,0
The house blend rubbed wings are the best I have ever had. I got 2 orders! 50 cent wings on Sunday and 4 Switchback beers,0
Once stop shopping for all your party needs,0
"Great place.  Its clean, the ladies are extremely friendly, and they take walk ins.  I was so pleased with my hair cut.  Michelle did a wonderful job! The prices are really reasonable too.  Definte 5 stars!!!!",0
Love it. Foods always good and the self serve kiosk is convenient,0
Its Taco Bell what more do you need to know?,0
Terrific people.  Have been going there for over 15 years.   They really care about our pets.,0
They're about as good as any other glass place,0
"A diner us a diner... Some suck, some are decent. This one is decent.",0
Delivery came early and the guy who dropped off the machine was very pleasant and professional. Picked up on time. Would use again.,0
Great cute shop off church street marketplace,0
"Great coffee, delicious baked goods, great staff and tdee best maple soft serve anywhere.",0
Very good food,0
Best place  ever Jen rocks the place👍👍👍👍👍👍😊😊😊😊😊,0
Great pricing,0
Attendants were friendly.  Touch free wash did a good job.,0
"Great selections very, very good prices.  The only problem I found was fence part accesories are not in store here or at Home Depot.

I was looking for a folding gate kit, or a tilt up latchable gate kit for the middle of a larger wooden gate so the gate would not fly open on windy days or when parking a trailer.  I guess I will design and build my own design here...",0
Great hotel for the following: Big rooms with a full kitchen. This hotel really excels in the long term stay guest type. There is no pool on site but the neighboring hotel allows full access to their pool and gym. There is laundry services on site (quarter operated). The biggest fault with this hotel is the house keeping service very hit or miss on the quality of the service. But they make up for it with the customer service of the front desk. It is a little bit further from downtown Burlington than i would normally like but the location is still convenient.  The best part is that they allow pets and they have the best breakfast so you should go and experience it and maybe bring your dog too!,0
Excellent every time !!!,0
"Great purchase.  Dave helped me get the truck I wanted and made sure that I had a loaner while I was waiting.  Great dealership, will defiantly be using Heritage next time I need a new truck.",0
Excellent food if you're in the area check it out. This barbeque is worth every penny!,0
Burger King is always a treat,0
"Awesome food, great atmosphere and the owner took the time to learn our names. Will definitely make it back sometime soon.",0
Affordable. Deli makes monster sandwiches.,0
Awesome momos,0
"Great food, Great service, Great atmoshere",0
Awesome food and views !,0
"Great variety of unique gift ideas. Vermont artisan jewelry, art, paper goods, cards, etc. Wonderful browsing experience through small, well laid-out and decorated shop.",0
Very friend an price fair,0
"Very accommodating  folks
Excellent  food and services
Menu needs to be enlarged
Great Great outstanding desserts
From your friend Ray....",0
I like the pizza here.,0
Yummy breakfast sandwich.  Nice outdoor eating options too.,0
"Not the easiest place to get to, being off the highway, but if you're looking for a very good Chinese take-out, heading through Vermont, this is a good choice.  Enjoyed very good chicken and broccoli, General Tso's chicken and egg rolls, in generous portions, in combination platters.",0
Very popular for children sports,0
Not as big as I expected. But they had Grade A Dark maple syrup that I was looking for. Yummy stuff.,0
The fried pork dumplings are fantastic. Best in town!,0
Busy most of the time.  Close to the interstate.,0
"The food was great, the atmosphere was relaxing. I would recommend this place to everyone.",0
I love their Seared Salmon Salad,0
Overpriced product with poor quality.Sevice was nearly no existent.,0
Best steak and cheese great food,0
"Bought a car here from skip ward last year, skip is the best sales guy I have ever worked with and would buy from him again. All the other sales guys here seem pretty sketchy and un trustworthy. The service department is Awesome every time, they will always fit you in and they do great work and everyone there is real easy to work with. I recommend the service dept here to everyone",0
Always a great experience and great food!,0
"Love these guys.  Very professional and thorough, not to mention the place is cleaner when they leave then when they come!   Highly recommend.",0
THE guy's are friendly and helpful.I love not having TO pump MY own gas THANK YOU for THE service,0
Small bar.  Bartenders very busy but fast and cordial. I had a fun time with a karaoke group.,0
"Large local beer list and good food!  It's a small food menu, but always good!",0
Over the top crazy good!,0
This is my go to barber shop. The staff are friendly and great to talk to. Their website makes appointments very easy and I always get the cut I want.,0
This is an amazing service.  We were able to alter 3 pets and they were able to get their shots.  Thankful for this service!,0
They don't except debt or credit cards cash only which I never carry,0
A nice find - they have really improved their menu and offerings.  The bartender is not going to win awards for her mixology skills.  Order beer and wine and you can't go wrong.,0
"Great venue at pizza kitchen downstairs. Good pizza, great service, awesome staff, good beer selection.",0
"The location is not easy to find, but so worth the trip! Good, solid theater (maybe a little spotty in places), in on of the most lovely pastoral settings you can find in Vermont. So worth the trip. Go early and picnic!",0
"Stopped here for a quick bite after a day of skiing at Killington and before we headed up to Stowe. And that's what we got - a bunch of really good burgers, cold beers, and friendly staff. And we were out of there in no time. Bonus for all the Dead-related memorabilia and a good soundtrack to eat to.",0
Brutal never ending death March with small climbing sections but a great view.,0
"Good food,  good service,  nice atmosphere.  A little small, so it does get crowded fast.  If you want to go there on a busy night,  you may want to make reservations",0
I had a great experience at McMahon's Chevrolet . They have great customer service and went above and beyond in helping me to aquire my new car .,0
Very few stores still open.,0
SLOW!!!! You shouldn't have to wait 27 minutes in the drive through at McDonalds.,0
"Great place for local food, from the ground up and prepared. One of the best things about Rutland with lots of local farmers and ethnic food offerings.",0
Phil will set you up with whatever you need they have it all,0
Great deals,0
Great vegan reuben and fries!,0
"1st time there and this place is beautiful on the inside.  The examination room was private and extremely clean.  They even offered coffee and water while we waited.  They offered water to our dog while waiting in the exam room. Staff were very nice and helpful.  The dr was very interested in hearing about her symptoms and did a full exam.  Sent us home w pain meds and antibiotics.  We have 2 dogs and for the 6 months each yr that we live in VT we will be happily taking our furbabies there.  Oh and they have a little store there that sells food, supplements, toys, candles, the cutest leashes and matching collars among other things.",0
Very good food and service,0
Very nice play ground.,0
"I have ordered from West Bratt Pizza several times at my fathers insistence (he prefers their pizza to Domino's). Each time delivery has been far too long, with my latest being 1½ HOURS. When I questioned the driver (and then the person in store over the phone) on my cold pizza that took far too long to get here, I was given a ""it'll get to you when it gets there"" attitude.

I have spent many years in the service industry, and poor customer service is a peeve of mine. I will NOT be ordering from them again.",0
"Food was good, but my father's spicy mustard was clumpy and his Budweiser was expired.",0
Great affordable place with great people :-),0
Very unique and worth the visit.,0
"Very nice people, I stopped here cause it looked clean and I needed a place to breast feed while i was traveling it was urgent, and they allowed me to do so even though i wadnt a customer, i bought a soda from them and i felt bad , but they told me not to worry about it
I would definitley reccommend this place just based off their kindness :)",0
It's a church. Probably a decent church if you're a church person.,0
Great service,0
Not bad for a Dollar general but fairly disorganized like most.,0
They don't help you out if you have a catastrophic in your life.,0
"Nice washers, strong dryer. Make sure to get a punch card !",0
U can trust your automobile it's in safe hands at Don's auto,0
"Love it, always good sales. I'll be really sad if they ever have to close. They're a great shopping option and good employer for our small community.",0
"Great beer supply, and nice people",0
This place gave me terrible food poisoning.,0
Friendly pub with nice staff and locals hanging out at the bar who are equally friendly. Food is good greasy pub fare with a nice outdoor deck area,0
The nicest employees work here and helped me install what I bought. Thank you. I highly recommend this store.,0
Great food!,0
Love this place.,0
We had a great lunch of perfectly prepared fish tacos. This was our first visit. We will definitely be back!,0
Nice place just not a lot of animals to choose from,0
Amazing staff and fabulous pick your own strawberries. Never have been there and will absolbe back!! Other producers available too!!,0
I like O'Reilly's for their knowledgeable and helpfull staff.,0
"Short, moderate, great view.",0
"Beautiful hike, very difficult though",0
"Well, it's quick & cheap...",0
Stop delivering the wrong packages to my house. I am 180. Not 181. You constantly do this .,0
Good food and waitress.,0
Courtney brassard is fantastic!,0
Good food fast service and a fair price. What else can I say.,0
Great store.  Closed at 4 Sunday.,0
"They were very nice and caring , I will continue to see them for all my skin conditions.",0
Beautiful place to go,0
Great quality stuff,0
"Pretty good beer selection, cozy atmosphere, and good pub fare.",0
Great food and social distancing.,0
Great beer,0
"Walk in appointments. Exceptionally fast and good service. 20 minutes from handing off my keys to getting them back for a basic oil change. Checked the basics - oil, lights, tires, wiper fluid etc. About $60 total. Will definitely bring my cars there for their regular oil service.",0
"Good food ,nice staff, great location..",0
So many flavors! All creemies are the same size!,0
I just got my car detailed today I couldn't be happier. Looks like new carpets clean as new smells great. Worth the money. They earned a regular customer. Thanks!,0
"I cannot recommend this place enough! I have a new-to-me older car (2011) and needed to get an oil change and a few questions answered. The folks are awesome! They were open in letting me know I could get a few more weeks out of the oil if I wanted to push the oil change out a bit, which was more honesty than I've ever seen in a service. They went as far as to walk me out on the garage floor to explain everything they did and anything that I should keep an eye on.  I really appreciated them being kind and willing to answer my questions. I'll be going to them for all future car maintenance!",0
"Great food!!
Nice quiet place to eat",0
"Food is decent, staff not always friendly",0
"The staff are very friendly, helpful and seem trustworthy. It seems to always be busy so appointments are highly recommended. It's a great place to fill propane tanks and get a legitimate car inspection (they are very thorough and won't let it pass even if you practically beg! 😜 They apparently want our vehicles to be safe! Thankfully!) It's also the only place in the area that allows you to use your Price Chopper Advantedge fuel rewards card. Highly recommended for all your car needs!",0
"Lovely place, good food, nice staff. Good beer selection and supportive of the community!",0
The pizza is the best. Good customer service too.,0
Really good subway! Great customer service and always helpful. Always have delivery ready for doordash!,0
Been doing McD's since 1950s all over the world and this is undoubtedly the only one worthy of a negative  rating.,0
Gas prices are usually high.Store is ok. They dont lose money on their foods. They have a small bank inside. They hace a porter potty for the public very disgusting.Think they could maybe get a loan from bank and put in a Clean real bath room inside.,0
"Favorite place, especially after work on a frigid day :) so warm and humid!!!!!!",0
This place has a great produce section and Organic King Arthur Flour.,0
Course is in great shape.  Friendly staff.,0
Such a great gem! Lovely spot and such great people!,0
Decent.,0
Fantastic food and service and friendly staff.,0
Very friendly really great service great people deal with,0
"Love their fries, especially just after the fryolater is cleaned. Usually a busy place and just finished update the interior of the building.",0
Had to wait. For 8 mins for chicken nuggets cook time is like 5,0
Very good,0
"Awesome town store, lots of goodies, fresh vegetables, great meat prices, cold beer and wine....a little pricy, but still fair. They rent tubes for the river. They are a State liquor store.",0
"The only real issue is the inconsistency of products. Something you get used to buying may go away forever or randomly show up again months later. There are people who snatch the best stuff right when it comes in, you have to be saavy when looking for specific things there I guess.",0
"They took a walk in, no foul, and accommodated perfectly. Great place, reasonable prices and friendly Old School barbers. Keep up the great work!",0
GREAT FOOD. NICE PEOPLE. GOOD PORTIONS.,0
Cheap stuff at cheap prices,0
It was closed so I have no opinion.,0
We often grab a bite when we are looking for a casual meal.  They have a great burger.  It would be nice if their restrooms were more accessible.,0
One of the places you need to go to complete your visit to Stowe.  Views are spectacular and it's good for your waistline too!,0
Good food and friendly staff. Prices are fair for what you get. Also a decent place to watch a game.,0
"I walked in ans though they had a great selection of items the whole store just felt dirty to me, things were out of place and their were half drank coffee cups sitting around, if your planning on going here just go to dollar tree",0
Delicious! Huge pancakes (I recommend the Nutella swirl). Feels homey and local! Huge gift shop attached.,0
So good!!,0
Billy's is no longer the new place is Bri's Fries and the food is great and the staff is very friendly.,0
Mmmmmmm. Beer,0
An absolutely heroic wine shop and market. They've got an unparelled selection with some of the most knowledgeable staff in town.  Also their lunch special of a sandwich with drink and chips is tasty as all get out. A bottle of wine and a lunch special or two for a summer picnic is just the ticket.,0
A little of everything. I really wish the Cinema was still here.,0
Best service. Way better than the alternatives. Such a pleasure to deal with.,0
Honest mechanic. A rarity in today's world. --Gold--,0
Good selections but a bit pricey.,0
"Immensely helpful staff, excellent food, supplements, beds, leashes, and treats for my dog. I always leave knowing I was in good hands while shopping.",0
They stock everything you would need for your pet and they are very helpful.,0
Nice people! Good service. Good food.,0
They have the best grinders around! A must try!,0
They have taken great care of our pet!,0
love DD coffee best ever!,0
Real good place to eat.,0
Good deli food from good people,0
"Casey was fast,polite,and professional thank you # 961#",0
Great place to explore. Cool caves and places to climb,0
What can I say? Vermont outdoors.  It's always beautiful and nice to get away from all the noise of everyday life.,0
Great choice of beer.. Good pub food.,0
