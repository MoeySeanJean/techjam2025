"Drinks were on point, service was sluggish, food all needed salt, when seasoned correctly it was delicious.
FYI Black Camo Lululemon is not a uniform choice, super hot but not for work.",1
Food quality was good. They have half price burgers on Monday (7$) which is a really good deal. The place is clean. The staff are friendly. However preparation time of the food was a little bit long. There restaurant was not that busy the night that we went and it took almost 40 minutes for 4 burgers. I like the place.,1

Everyday low prices!,1
Decor and menu are rediculiously OUTDATED. Restaurant is  very dirty and needs a deep cleaning as well as completely updating the decor and  new menu items. Its a hit or miss on the customer service as well.,1
"Wow. This place has gone to the pits!! Used to get good portions but they have skimped down to where the bacon is no bigger than a plastic forks and the eggs look like they are Robbin eggs.

Core customers are leaving due to this and due to the lack of personality of the wait staff. ZERO PERSONALITY!!

Go to Wayside!! Great resteraunt, clean AND great food. Waitresses are like extended member family! Makes Soups and Greens look like a by product of McDonalds",1

"They are so good with our 4 month old puppy. The place is clean and smells nice. They strive to make it an enjoyable experience for both pet and owners. They take the time to answer questions and to make sure you are ok with the amount of services provided, as well as the price. I love the loyalty program! We got $10 off our last well check with it!",1

Noel T. Liddy is definitely the person to talk to about getting a new vehicle!,1
"When asking yourself who should I talk to about buying a vehicle the answer is NOEL LIDDY!!

Our experience with Noel Liddy was one of the best experiences we have had at any dealership. If it wasn't for Noel we would have walked away from the Jeep we intended to purchase. Noel supports his customers, gives them space to make decisions and really makes you feel at home.  Noel would do anything for you to ensure your experience is positive, unlike many other sales consultants who are pushy Noel was far from pushy and was very easy to talk to and very easy going and funny.

I have never dealt with a man with such high integrity, high standards for himself and professionalism. I will be seeing Noel Liddy again when I am purchasing and or looking at leasing a vehicle.

I would additionally like to add that Brian the owner of Goss Dodge is a very stand-up man and makes sure that each and every customer is taken care of.",1

Trash shop that know nothing about cars we brought my mother's car there for a oil change they did a inspection on the front end and Chris ferdanan quoted it needed a inner tie rod end took us to look at the part and upon inspection It was not the tie rod it was the control arm bushings he fought up and down that it was the tie rod so we took it back to our shop to have DMV inspect the car and confirmed the same thing as I said the control arm bushings. Becareful of this place a bunch of part swappers that have no idea what's going on under the hood of a car if you make the mistake to have service done here get a second option or you will get taken for a money ride. DON'T GO HERE WORST PLACE FOR YOUR CAR!!!!!!,1
Reap off! I was charged almost $400 to change a few inches on my muffler.,1
So today I took my mom's car to get a oil change and they did a safety inspection like they do with every car. We went to pick up the car after work and they said there were a few issues with the car so they took us to the shop to see what was wrong and the tech Chris ferdanan was there they showed us the issues and tryed to up sell parts and they didn't know what they were talking about when I called him out on it! My family has had a shop for over 50 years with some of the best techs in the state. I grabbed the the rod and no clunk like he said then he said it was leaking oil but no oil appeared on the ground so dates the leak? These guys are a bunch of jokes with a shop acting like they know what they are talking about! They have a ase plack on the wall but to display one 3 out of the 4 guys in the shop have to have the cert no one in the shop has one of you check the database! Liers and retards for sure don't take your car here at all you will regreate it!!!!,1

"Payless shoe outlet in the u-mall in s. Burlington is closeing. Going out of business. Everything is 50-75% off.
Best time to grab up alot of shoes for kids and maybe grab some for yourself at this price. I personally never been a fan of payless shoes. However i didnt find anything i liked at their low low prices due to closing.",1
Chap shoes. Plus they are going out of business. Not a surprise to me.,1

"They say to have liquor delivery sent to you to use a service called shipt but when I clicked on the button for a liquor delivery the only thing that comes up are the grocery stores and the drug stores! When I attempt to send that delivery place a messagemessage, it says it will be answered within 10 days! And if that's not true then why do you have that link on your page? That's false advertising!",1
People that work there are friendly .i if you pre pay for gas you get a free cup of coffee .Tony an Tonya are cool .plus the liquor store is next door .So get your beer .chips an dip .an Some Jack Daniels next door,1
They got what you need. It ain't cheap but what place is?,1

Great place to buy groceries from Bosnia.,1
Open on Christmas Eve!,1
"Apparently if you order a larger sandwich.. I ordered 3 foot longs... with extras.. that makes it impossible to fold ..and the employee didn't like that... so the retaliation was to drown said sandwiches with condiments til the bread was absolute mush and complain about having to cut said sandwich in half...and yes the manager was there instigating the employees behavior.

!!!!!WORST SUBWAY EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!",1
"This place honestly is a joke. They are always filthy as hell when I go in plus on top of it they do not ever get my order right. I hand the college (I assume is bright enough) cashier my 20 for a 10 dollar sandwich yet she keeps the rest.... I am not tipping you nor am I ever giving you one. Can you honestly just not make correct change or are you unable to do that, but somehow be hired by subway one of my favorite places to eat. Since my experience with you I will no longer be dining here nor any subway for that matter. So honestly subway if you're out there please ditch the people here and return it to it's glory!! I am very dissatisfied subway. I wish I could give less then one star.",1
The veggie delight is a good deal.,1
"Disgusting.  Doesnt matter what one you go to.  Unclean, the food is terrible, and how can you trust a sandwich shop that trucks in pre sliced meat.  Seriously, next time youre there ask them if you can see the slicer and watch the confused looks you get.",1
Good location.. If u dont wear gloves dont touch my food .my motto an dont tell me stupid jokes an make my sandwich..I need to eat not puke,1

"Neat little gem in the heart of Burlington that I otherwise would not have even known existed, if it were not for a friend that mentioned something about it the other day.  I had no idea where to park my car, but my son and I hopped on the trail and trekked through the woods for about two hours looking all around. Pretty cool trail system lots of turns and different paths to choose.
I feel like this is something that a lot of people I've talked to don't even know exist oh, but then I mentioned it to another friend whose only lived here for a couple years and they know exactly what I'm talking about and where it is.
I've been here for almost 20 years and had no clue how silly but pretty cool.",1

Ray Beane is the only shop around where I get good mileage out of the tires because they align a vehicle right the first time. I get twice the life from Ray Beane tires than anywhere else. I can get a set of tires and leave without paying crazy prices or have to worry about an improper alignment like I have received from Town fair tires. Go to John and get it done proper,1
Such a beautiful place to visit! Their 60 day aged wax wrapped cheese is to die for!,1
We stopped in here and picked up some awesome Plymouth Garlic and Herb block and went so well with crackers and a bottle of Merlot. Booyah!,1
The cheese is awesome and the location in the historic Calvin Coolidge site is cool. Anyone skiing at Killington or Okemo needs to visit.,1
Great prices of name brand footwear..,1
"They have shoe brand I prefer(new balance) at an affordable price. Also nice discounts available with card. The more you spend the more you save. They also have extensive selection of carhartt merchandise. The owner is from this area originally, so I support local businesses. Attention to customer service is a priority. They do a really nice job. Worth a visit. With me they have a customer for life. Highly recommended.",1
Good prices.,1
If you're nurse traveling to the area great little spot to stop and pick up uniforms or shoes get signed up for their super shoes reward and get your points going my wife and I love the place,1
Fresh coffee and locally baked donuts! Parking on street and inside parking lot. Great seating. Bright and inviting atmosphere.,0
No impressed with the food . My husband got sick when we left. Will not be back .,0
"Very clean, quiet and calm veterinary facility. I was in with my new puppy who had a serious uti just a week after getting her and our regular vet was out of town. My only reason for removing a star was that they took her out of the room for an ultrasound examination to determine if they could get a urine sample, and I would have much preferred the option to stay with her, especially since I didn‚Äôt know any of them.",0
After they replaced a recalled airbag sensor drove less than 3 mile and airbag light came on,0
I brought a car in for a pre purchase inspection.  The technician there said that the brakes would 100% fail a Vermont State Inspection.  The car only had 23k miles on it.  I took a picture of the repair order and the brake pads.   They will be attached.  BUNCH OF SNAKES IN THE GRASS!  Wanted 700 bucks to replace brakes on a Hyundai sedan.  CROOKS.  I am going to report them to the Atty General for price gouging during a crisis.,0
They are now open for retail sales. Happy day. They inside is very clean and fresh looking. The ladies are very happy to be back at work. Pick up some goodies. It's Easter üòá,0
Friendly customer service,0

"One of my favorite spots in Burlington for coffee.  Nice place with plenty of space and nice, friendly staff know know coffee and go out of their way to give you a great experience.  Recommended.",0
Prices are higher then other Shaw's,0
Friendly fast staff!,0
"I understand shops make some money off marking up parts and don't particularly like it when customers bring their own, but this place is a little ridiculous. $140/hour labor rate because I brought in my own wheel bearing. Plus, the mechanics are amateurs. I'm no certified technician by any means, but I knew I didn't need a steering rack when they were certain I did. It seems as if they try to pull the jiffy lube-like scams. Furthermore, the manager was an ass after his imbecilic employee couldn't give me a straight answer when I had some questions about my outrageous bill. Save yourself the time, money and stress by never going to one of these chain garages. Go find yourself a reliable, honest, sincere, local mechanic who deserves the business.",0
It's a grocery store. Their price point is a bit high but when you want convenience someone has to pay for it.,0
It is good Chinese food even though they don't serve pork because of Muslims.,0
Good selection of decent food. The price is OK.,0
"Great produce, lots of selection, excellent staff!",0
"They raised the price of their dinner...$15.88 for buffet, soda, and tax! Every time I go here (rarely), I wish I hadn't.  Definitely wasn't worth it.",0
"Classic Chinese buffet. Always clean, great fast friendly service.",0
5 because the employees are very willing to help! Great selection and the hannaford app has made everything even better with clipped coupons and rewards.,0
"Got treated very well by the Midas team; handled my car and alloy rims with care, were true to appointment time and duration, and priced very reasonably.
Many thanks!!",0
Very caring and well equipped.  I would never take my pets anywhere else!,0
"Great food, decent prices, about twenty minute wait time. Can be very busy around seven.",0
The staff are always very nice.  A great variety of food.  Great price.  Almost always fresh because it's popular enough to keep the food rotating.,0
On the small side for a supermarket.,0
"Best grocery store in the surrounding area, even prefer this pharmacy over all others around this area!",0
"It's a big relief to relocate somewhere brand new, and on the first try you find a great vet for your dog. Like everyone else, not just anyone with a DVM can see my Dominic.
Professional, thorough, and compassionate.",0
Good old fashioned home style diner,0
"Had an emergency visit on Saturday morning, was able to be slotted in very quickly. Pet needed transfer to another facility, which was handled promptly. Records had been submitted to receiving facility electronically, and were there when I arrived. Staff pleasant, kind, and understanding.",0
Having to leave my backpack at the door makes me nervous. I keep my valuables in it.,0
"Kind of pricey, and busy.",0
Good prices. Easy to find what yoy want.,0
"Great selection of european products, we were impressed with what we found. We even found ""pufule»õi"" and ""apƒÉ mineralƒÉ Borsec"".",0
The produce and meat sections are well-maintained.  Prices of a lot of items are lower than that of other grocery stores in the Central Vermont area.,0
Great place,0
The best chinese. Alot better then Rutland's Chinese food,0
Nice place to bring the little ones,0
Always delicious,0
"Taco Tuesday, great!  Eat up!!!",0
Dusappointing.  The name suggests soup and salad but it was more comfort food.,0
Great selection and friendly service,0
"At first glance of the atmosphere (it's OK) and menu (basic choices and cheap prices) you may think, ""why is this place so popular?"" Then you get your food and that moment of realization occurs--the food captures that 'homemade' feel--it was delicious, affordable, and each dish came with more than enough re: servings/portions. Overall, I would certainly come back.",0
"Bad food, shaky service and bad atmosphere",0
My no#1 market,0
Was great,0
Food is disgusting,0
Great food evwrtytime i go!,0
Love buying meat here!,0
Went to a celebration of life was very nice food was excellent.,0
Delicious! Great curbside pickup protocol.,0
No that bad just another Subway,0
Not much taste.,0
"Very solid dealership experience.  Low pressure, great finance team.  Tyler Cormier was a fantastic salesperson to work with.  I am very happy with my new car it is a blast!  Would definitely feel comfortable recommending this place to any friends or family.  Edit: Bought a second car from them-it was an equally great experience.  Edit: Third Car. Gets better every time. Thanks again!",0
Good meals,0
I love my Java Chip!,0
Standard grocery store.  I make a point to go here for fish and gluten free pizza dough.,0
Hate this place takes 15 minutes to get a coffee with no one in line and get charged way too much won't spend another nickle of my money here,0
"Basic in menu, quality, and price yet all are well aligned. If you like the home town family style of restaurant that gives you the impression the linin is laundered with the family whites, this is a great spot. Not a quality gastronomic experience but a basic mainstay for locals on a budget. Would go again, but not a destination.",0
Very cramped,0
I love their sales and deals,0
Went here recently for a bday party that we all ordered a ton of food for to just share. Everything was really good. It's deifnitely a little pricey but well worth it for the quality and quantity of the food and drinks.,0
Love the pizza,0
"I shop here each week. From wonderful selections to nice helpful staff, this place never disappoints. And if they do, they will make it right.",0
"Shop till you drop, groceries etc üòÉ",0

Convenient,0
They're the absolute best... It's wonderful to know that they take care of your pet like you would. I would highly recommend them to anyone that loves their pet!,0
"A small selection of items, but at a very good price. If you're looking for English muffins or loaves of bread for 1/2 or even 1/3 the price in store, this is the place for you! Also has discounted donuts and other bakery snacks, like danishes and pies.",0
I had things in my food that I had no clue what it was and when we called them back to tell them they weren't very friendly about it and wanted to replace my order but we decided to not go there again.,0
Best place to get your groceries around the area. Great prices along with Fast and freindly service.,0
"A nice place for coffee, where you can still bring a laptop and work. Can't say that for some of the other places in Burlington at this point, so that is a real +.",0
"Quick service, friendly workers.",0
The staff are all knowledgeable and kind to my dogs. I have 5 so visit frequently. I love the automated appointment and follow up reminders! It makes monitoring routine care a breeze. They always get right back to me with any question or concern about my pets. I greatly appreciate them and absolutely love their new location. ü§ó,0
The donuts are better at Price Chopper,0
They really care about coffee. Good quality hot coffee. Iced mocha was inconsistent over a couple visits.,0
Good food,0
"Always the best food, no matter what I order. The service is always prompt and with the staff is great!",0
Love love love Dunkins!,0
Pretty decent food and drinks,0
"I stood in a long line while employees helped people at the end of the line go to registers. So the first half, many of us, waited, while people who just walked up to the registers were immediately helped. Shoukdnt a line be first come, first serve? Not backwards? Never seen that before",0
Awsome as always,0
My first time there service was amazing my fur baby came back out happy very good place to bring your fur babies,0
"Compassionate, caring staff and an impeccably clean space.  They're so good at what they do.",0

"OK produce, expensive.",0
Seafood platter excellent.,0
Bland food,0
Nice and friendly people,0
"My mom is British and really missed good fish and chips with mushy peas. The Fish and Chip nails it. Pick your fish (halibut, haddock, or cod) and enjoy. Curry sauce is available for the chips. The $12.95 lunch special.is awesome. Haddock, chips/fries, coleslaw, soup or salad, and soft drink. Bummed that the soda machine isn't set up for soda water but the rest was fantastic.",0
Not what I expected.,0
"I pay top dawrer for poke flied wice :)
Seriously gr8 service and gr8 grub!",0
"Great home style food like your mom makes, with a relaxed homey atmosphere. The food is great, best soup & salad bar for miles around and the steamship round of beef on Saturday nights is scrumptious. The best food selection for what ever time of day you go!",0
Great breakfast spot.,0
"Always a pleasure. Clean, friendly and convenient.",0
"Great local restaurant. Good steak and seafood selection at good prices for Chittenden county, with very good portions. Service is very friendly. The place was newly renovated a few years ago and is clean and good condition.",0
"Great food, great atmosphere... love the fried ice cream!",0
Fast service,0
Nice grocery store,0
Amazing food salad bar is great  chicken fingers are tender anything you have is good. The managers are awesome along with the wait staff and the owners,0
I have never had a worse experience in a restaurant before. A long wait for everything. When we got our appetizers truffle fries 2 soups and a Caesar salad to share. The salad looked like it had sat there for for a while before being served. Our fries were ok. The onion soup needed serious help starting with properly cutting the onions for the onion soup. They were huge and not cooked. Could have done without the scallions all over everything.  The best part was the broccoli cheddar soup it was delicious. Out plates got cleared. Then it was at least another 10 to 15 min before our entrees arrived.My husband's ribs were ok. My filet got put down and it was are and still jiggling at me. It practically had horns still. I sent it back to be cooked to what it was supposed to be medium rare. It came back out from the kitchen in less than 5 minutes well done not wrapped in bacon with splatter from the microwave all over the plate. I know something doesn't go rare to well in that time frame even in a 500 degree oven. This was the first time ever I have sent something back and not even eaten a main course. And the manager never came over to see if there was anything they could do to rectify the issue. Very disappointing establishment.,0
Always great sandwiches,0
These folks have the best produce outside of a farmer's market... The Best... it's stays fresh longer than any other produce I've bought at any other grocery store.,0
"Unique space with mixed architectural features, art for sale on the walls and a medium-sized cocktail list. The burgers have been inconsistent but there was
a great brussel sprout app and the scallops were delicious. Make a reservation and for a quieter experience opt out of the bar area.",0
They sell what you need and the people behind the counter are always polite and very helpful.,0
Lots of great stuff,0
"I'd heard a bunch of bad things, but it's a decent small town grocery store. Produce section was well stocked with fresh items. I found everything I was looking for...",0
Slow service at the drive-thru. Mess up on your items more often then not but the food was good and the service was good.,0
"Wonderful staff, wonderful service! The mechanic brought me into the shop to show me what he was working on & to explain why. The estimate was accurate & included comprehensive details. I'll definitely be back!",0
